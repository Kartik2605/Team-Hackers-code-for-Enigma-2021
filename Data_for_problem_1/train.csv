ATEL #12339,Optical,"
We report spectroscopic observations of AT2018lab, discovered by the DLT40
survey on UT 2018 Dec 29.13 in the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) IC 2163.
The observations were performed using the FLOYDS spectrograph on Faulkes-South
on UT 2018 Dec 29.46.  The spectrum reveals a mostly featureless blue continuum.
We also note the presence of H-alpha emission in our spectrum with FWHM
of 400 km/s.  This feature could be associated with the host galaxy IC
2163, but is blueshifted from the nominal recessional velocity of the host
by 600 km/s.

ATEL #12340,X-ray,"
On 2018 December 21, MAXI/GSC detected a bright hard X-ray transient source,
MAXI J1631-479, in the Norma region (Kobayashi et al., ATEL#12320). The
X-ray pulsar AX J1631.9-4752/IGR J16320-4751 is within the MAXI error circle
and was suggested to be the source producing the bright transient emission.
However, the Swift/BAT position reported for the bright source (GCN#23550)
is 8.4 arcminutes away from the XMM position of AX J1631.9-4752.  As this
is significantly more than the 3 arcminute uncertainty (90% confidence)
in the Swift/BAT position, we obtained two NuSTAR observations on December
28: a 14 ks observation pointed at the Swift/BAT position and a 12 ks observation
pointed at AX J1631.9-4752. 

In the 14 ks NuSTAR observation, we found a very bright source at R.A.
= 247.806 deg, Decl. = -47.805 deg (J2000) with an uncertainty of 15 arcsec.
This position is consistent with the Swift/BAT position and is not consistent
with the position of AX J1631.9-4752.  In addition, a search of the SIMBAD
database does not show any known source consistent with the NuSTAR position.
Thus, we conclude that MAXI J1631-479 is a new X-ray transient. 

The NuSTAR observations were performed when the source was 34 degrees away
from the sun. As the sun is close to the FOV, the star tracker used for
aspect reconstruction was only available approximately for 2.6 ks, but
we were able to obtain the source position with NuSTAR nominal astrometric
accuracy due to the brightness of the source. 

The source is detected across the 3-79 keV NuSTAR bandpass with a count
rate in excess of 600 c/s (FPMA and FPMB combined).  An absorbed disk-blackbody
plus power-law model provides a reasonably good description of the continuum
with a reduced chi2 of 1.25 for 893 degrees of freedom.  The column density
is (2.9+/-0.2)e22 atoms/cm2 (using wilm abundances), the temperature of
the disk-blackbody is 1.12+/-0.01 keV, and the power-law photon index is
2.39+/-0.02 (90% confidence errors).  The 3-79 keV and 2-10 keV absorbed
fluxes are 1.8e-8 erg/cm2/s and 1.7e-8 erg/cm2/s, respectively.  The residuals
show clear evidence for an iron Kalpha emission line, and adding a broad
gaussian with an equivalent width of 90 eV improves the fit significantly.
This demonstrates that we are seeing a reflection component in the spectrum.

The spectral properties of MAXI J1631-479 indicate that it is very likely
to be an accreting black hole in the soft state.  In the future, further
work on the MAXI and Swift/BAT data may provide more information about
the overall evolution of the current outburst.  The source is still in
outburst, and multi-wavelength observations are encouraged.  Based on the
behavior of other black hole transients, the outburst may last for another
month or more.

SALT spectroscopy of the MASTER transient (Gorbovskoy et al., ATel #12338),
detected inside the localization region of FRB181228 (Farah et al., ATel
#12335), was undertaken on 2018 December 29.808 (HJD 2458482.3079).  The
transient, which is in the galaxy LEDA 499631 (2MASS J06092523-4732490),
was observed for 1200 s with the SALT Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS)
using the PG900 VPH grating covering the spectral region 3445-7400 &#8491;
at a resolution of R = 1040. The spectrum was fitted using the SNID code
(Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), with the best match being a SN
Type Ia, 10 days post-maximum, with a redshift in the range 0.025-0.031.
We conclude this SNe is unlikely to be associated with FRB181228.

ATEL #12336,Infra-Red,"
We are monitoring PKS0346-27 since its Gamma-ray outburst in February 2018
(ATel #11251) with the REM telescope on La Silla (ATel #11269). After the
NIR and optical brightening announced respectively by Carrasco et al. (ATel
#12310) and Kumar et al. (ATel #12324) we obtained a 3061s ToO pointing
by Swift-XRT and UVOT instruments on 2018-12-25.6; nearly simultaneous
r,i,J,H data were collected by our REM monitoring. The source is also very
bright in Gamma-ray since mid December (peaking around 1E-6 ph/s in the
100-300000 MeV range) from the public LAT-monitored sources (https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/source/PKS_0346-27)
. 

Swift data were analized with the tools available at the SSDC (www.ssdc.asi.it);
REM data were measured with IRAF/APPHOT using 2MASS and UCAC4 nearby comparison
stars. The X-ray flux was 0.111 +-0.007 c/s: the spectrum was well fitted
by a power law with photon index -1.60 +-0.11 using 12 PHA bins with a
reduced chi square 1.28. Photometry was available for all six UVOT filters
(V,B,U,W1,M2,W2): V= 16.78 +-0.05; B=17.34 +-0.05; U=16.46 +-0.04; W1=16.40
+-0.05; M2=16.55 0.05; W2=16.71 0.04  .  
REM images show the source at H=13.57 +-0.05, half-magnitude fainter than
H=13.04 reported in ATel #12310 by Carrasco et al. on Dec 19;  J=14.54
+-0.05; i=16.35 +-0.05; r=16.65 +-0.03. The optical-NIR spectrum, from
the H to the W2 band, is well fitted by a power law with photon index -2.52
. Overall the spectral energy distribution (SED) is fully consistent with
a Synchrotron emission for the NIR-optical and an Inverse Compton for the
X-ray branch (see figure).

ATEL #12335,Radio,"
At UTC 2018-12-28-13:48:50.1 (2018-12-28.5755799), we found a bright fast
radio burst as part of the ongoing search program (UTMOST), at the Molonglo
telescope. 

Molonglo is a 1.6 km long East-West array (Bailes et al 2017, PASA, 34,
45) and was operating in drift-scan mode with pointing centred on the meridian
at the time of detection. Source localisation is excellent in Right Ascension
(5 arcsec at 1-sigma) but poor in 
Declination (~1.2 deg at 1-sigma) (see Caleb et al 2017 MNRAS 468, 3746).

FRB181228
was found during a blind FRB search programme in real-time using an automated
GPU-accelerated/machine learning based pipeline and the raw voltages were
recorded for offline processing. 

The optimal dispersion measure (DM) that maximizes the signal-to-noise
ratio is: 
354 pc cm^-3
. The DM estimate of NE2001 model is ~58 pc cm^-3, and YMW16 model is ~61
pc cm^-3 at this position, resulting in an intergalactic excess of ~290
pc cm^-3. The upper limit on the DM-inferred redshift is thus 
z ~ 0.26
. 

An early estimate (lower limit) of the apparent fluence of the event is
~ 18 Jy ms (corrected for attenuation of the primary beam in the RA direction,
but not in the Dec direction), width ~ 2.19 ms, with a detection signal-to-noise
ratio = 12. 

The most likely position is RA = 06:09:54.5, DEC = -45:59:00, J2000, Galactic:
Gl = 253.3915 deg, Gb = -26.0633 deg. The 95% confidence localisation arc
is as follows: (RA, DEC) in (hours, deg) 

6.152928 -48.822722 

6.153536 -48.321778

6.158808 -43.312333 

6.159264 -42.811389  

A formula describing the localisation arc is:

RA = 6.016988 - 4.092281e-3*(DEC - 45.967341)  - 2.804353e-05*(DEC - 45.967341)**2

ATEL #12333,Gamma Ray,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope,
has observed a gamma-ray flare from a source positionally consistent with
the flat-spectrum radio source, PKS 0517-726 (RA = 79.1571608 deg, Decl.
= -72.6187408 deg, J2000; Johnston et al. 1995 AJ 110, 880), with no known
redshift.  

Preliminary analysis indicates that on December 25, 2018 the source was
in a high state with a gamma-ray daily averaged flux (E>100MeV) of (0.4
+/- 0.1) x10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (uncertainty is statistical only), and a
single power-law photon index of 2.5 +/- 0.3. It was also detected on December
14, 2018 with the same flux of (0.4 +/- 0.1) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1, but
with a harder spectrum (photon index = 1.8 +/- 0.2). The source was initially
reported as a low-significance LAT source in the LMC field (Abdo et al.
2010 A&A 512, 7). 

Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring
of this source will continue. In consideration of the activity of this
source we strongly encourage multiwavelength observations. The Fermi LAT
contact person for this source is B. Rani (bindu.rani at nasa.gov). 

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

S-CUBED (Kennea et al., 2018, ApJ, 868, 47) is a weekly survey of the SMC
in X-ray, performed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, consisting of
142 tilings each with a 60s exposure time.  

Starting on Dec 27th, the Be/XRB SXP 756, which had previously been detected
sporadically by S-CUBED at fluxes around 2.4 x 10<sup>-12</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>
(0.5 - 10 keV), showed a significant brightening, and rose to a flux level
of 5.7 x 10<sup>-11</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>, an XRT count rate of 0.55
+/- 0.08 count/s. Assuming an SMC distance of 62 kpc, this is equivalent
to a luminosity of 1.1 × 10<sup>37</sup> erg/s. 

This outburst is the first by SXP 756 detected by S-CUBED since observations
began in June 2016. Follow-up observations of this outburst have been requested

ATEL #12329,Infra-Red,"
We observed the field of ATLAS18bcde/AT2018kpo (Smartt et al. ATel #12326)
as part of the GREAT survey (Chen et al. 2018, ApJ, 867L, 31), simultaneously
in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120, 405) mounted
at the MPG 2.2m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory (Chile), 
<p/> 

Observations started at 02:01 UT on 2018-12-25 (MJD = 58477.084), 0.71
days after the ATLAS discovery. We derive the following magnitudes (all
in the AB system) using aperture photometry with a aperture of the mean
FWHM of the field stars: 

g' = 17.36 +/- 0.01 mag,<br />  
r' = 17.74 +/- 0.01 mag,<br />  
i' = 18.01 +/- 0.01 mag,<br />  
z' = 18.12 +/- 0.01 mag,<br />  
J = 18.62 +/- 0.04 mag,<br />  
H = 19.05 +/- 0.11 mag, and<br />  
K = 19.16 +/- 0.33 mag.<br /> 

We also observed the other epoch 3 hours later, at 05:16 UT on 2018-12-25
(MJD = 58477.220), 

g' = 17.36 +/- 0.01 mag,<br />  
r' = 17.71 +/- 0.01 mag,<br />  
i' = 17.96 +/- 0.01 mag,<br />  
z' = 18.06 +/- 0.02 mag,<br />  
J = 18.48 +/- 0.05 mag,<br />  
H = 19.20 +/- 0.16 mag, and<br />  
K = 19.07 +/- 0.33 mag.<br /> 
No significant variation in all bands. <br /> 

Given magnitudes are calibrated against SDSS field stars as well as 2MASS
field stars and are not corrected for the expected Galactic foreground
extinction corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V) = 0.05 mag in the direction
of the transient (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011).  

After correcting for Milky Way extinction, we fitted SED assuming a black
body, which indicates a temperature of >20000 K. This object may have risen
0.5 mag/day roughly compared between GROND-r and ATLAS-o bands.   

We acknowledge excellent help in obtaining these data from our Chilean
colleagues on La Silla at Christmas Eve.

We observed the transient ATLAS18bcde (AT2018kpo) (Smartt et al. ATel 
#12326) by the GWAC-F60A telescope at 2018-12-25T10:55:21. The R-band 
brightness calibrated through the USNOB1.0 catalog is 17.1mag, which is

brighter than the GROND followup observations taken at 8 hours before 
(Chen et al. ATel#12329).   

The low resolution spectrum of ATLAS18bcde (AT2018kpo) has been 
obtained by the NAOC Xinglong 2.16m telescope with the BEFOSC 
spectragraph at 2018-12-25T12:08. The spectrum taken by an exposure  
of 1800s shows the transient has a quite blue featureless spectrum. 
after correcting for the Milky Way extinction by E(B-V)=0.05mag 
(Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011).

ATEL #12325,Optical,"
ASASSN-18ro (a.k.a., SN 2018evt, RA: 13:46:39.21  Dec: -09:38:35.75 ) was
discovered by All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee
et al. 2014; Atel #11963) on  UT 2018-08-11.00 at V ~ 16.5 mag (absolute
magnitude M_V ~  -18.8 mag) in the host galaxy MCG -01-35-011 (z = 0.024971;
A_V = 0.15 mag for Galactic extinction via NED). It was classified by ePESSTO
as a SN Ia (best match SN Ia 1991T-like; Atel #11947). 

Recent ASAS-SN observations of ASASSN-18ro show that it is at g ~ 16.4
mag on UT 2018-12-16.36 and g ~ 16.6 mag on 2018-12-22.09. Therefore, after
4 months of its discovery, the luminosity of ASASSN-18ro is still at about
-19 mag, and such a high late-time luminosity is not compatible with the
light curve of a typical (1991T-like) SN Ia. We note that ZTF and Gaia
also recently detect ASASSN-18ro at a similar brightness, i.e. r = 16.24
+/- 0.02 mag on UT 2018-12-16.54 from ZTF  (available via Lasair: https://lasair.roe.ac.uk/object/ZTF18actuhrs/)
and G = 16.32 mag on UT 2018-12-17.18 from Gaia Transient Alerts (http://gsaweb.ast.cam.ac.uk/alerts/alert/Gaia18dwd/).

Re-inspection of the ePESSTO spectrum (taken with the ESO-NTT / EFOSC2-NTT
at UT 2018-08-12.9995; available via TNS: https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018evt)
shows a prominent H-alpha emission line with FWHM ~ 1000 km/s (EW ~ 22
Angstrom). The archival 6dF spectrum (available via NED) at the nucleus
of the host galaxy does not show any H-alpha emission. The H-alpha emission
line likely origins from CSM interactions, which may also explain the high
late-time luminosity of ASASSN-18ro. We note that some 1991T-like SNe Ia
have been shown to have evidence of CSM interactions (e.g., Harris et al.,
2018, ApJ, 868, 21; Graham et al., 2018, arXiv:1812.02757 and references
therein). 

Further follow-up observations are strongly encouraged.

ATLAS is a twin 0.5m telescope system on Haleakala and Mauna Loa which

is robotically surveying the sky above declination -40 with a cadence 
of 2 days (Tonry et al. 2018, PASP, 13, 064505). Two filters are 
used, cyan and orange (denoted c and o; all mags quoted are in the AB 
system). While carrying out the primary mission for Near Earth 
Objects, we search for and publicly report stationary transients to 
the IAU Transient Name Server. More information is on 
http://www.fallingstar.com. We are submitting Astronomer's Telegrams 
for transients that are either within 100 Mpc, or have some other 
interesting feature to bring to the community's attention, such as 
bright nuclear transients, slowly rising or rapidly fading objects. 

We report a new, young transient source, most likely a supernova in the

galaxy MCG-01-10-019. We discovered ATLAS18bcde (AT2018kpo) on MJD 
58476.37 == 2018 December 24.37 UT, at m_o = 18.1 +/- 0.2. ATLAS18bcde
is offset 
by 29.58 arcsec south, 1.03 arcsec east from MCG-01-10-019, which is at

z=0.018 or d=70 +/- 5 Mpc (from NED). Implying an absolute magnitude of

M =-16.2 (assuming m-M = 34.2 and A_o = 0.1). 

An upper limit of o < 19.3 was measured 24hrs earlier, implying a rise

of > 1 mag in the first day.  A summary of the transient's properties 
are summarised below. Follow up observations are encouraged.

"
ATEL #12327,Gamma Ray,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed the brightest ever gamma-ray flare from a
source positionally consistent with the flat spectrum radio quasar TXS
0646-176 also known as 3FGL J0648.8-1740 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218,
23). Its coordinates are R.A. = 102.1187437 deg, Decl. = -17.7348444 deg
(J2000; Petrov et al. 2006, AJ, 131, 1872), and it has a redshift z=1.232
(Hewitt & Burbidge 1993, ApJS, 87, 451). 

Preliminary analysis indicates that on December 22, TXS 0646-176 reached
a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (3.6+/-0.6)X10^-6 photons
cm^-2 s^-1 (uncertainty is statistical only). This corresponds to a flux
increase of a factor of about 170 relative to the average flux reported
in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL). This is the highest LAT daily flux
ever observed for this source, nearly two and a half times greater than
observed during a previous flaring episode in Nov 2018 (ATel #12252). 
It has a corresponding photon index (E>100 MeV) of 2.4+/-0.2 which is consistent
with the 3FGL value of 2.5+\-0.1. 

Previous flaring activity has been reported by Fermi LAT in June 2018 (ATel#11706)
and July 2015 (ATel#7833). An optical flare was observed in this source
on Nov 12 (ATel#12293). 

Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray
monitoring of this source will continue. A preliminary estimation of the
daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi-LAT will be publicly available (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/).
In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source, we encourage multiwavelength
observations. For this source the Fermi LAT contact person is S. Ciprini
(stefano.ciprini@ssdc.asi.it). 

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

"
ATEL #12328,Optical,"
We report optical photometry of the flat spectrum radio quasar J1153-1105,
obtained with the 2.56m Nordic Optical Telescope in La Palma, to look for
any enhanced optical activity associated with a recent flare in the daily
averaged gamma-ray flux seen in Fermi J1153-1124 (ATel#12206, ATel#12208).

These NOT observations were made using the ALFOSC (Alhambra Faint Object
Spectrograph and Camera) instrument at the epoch 2018-12-09T07:04. Standard
IRAF data reduction (de-biasing + flat field correction with twilight flats)
was carried out and differential photometry was performed. The brightness
was calibrated against 17 
SDSS field stars near the target. The std-dev of the zero point was 0.03
mag. 

We find that PKS J1153-1105  had an SDSS r-magnitude = 18.82 +- 0.03 (AB-system).
This result suggests that there is significant enhancement in its optical
magnitude. An historic value of this object's r-magnitude from PanSTARRS
at mean epoch 2013-02-24 is 19.3 (Chambers et al. 2016, arXiv:1612.05560).

This brightening supports the identification of Fermi J1153-1124 with PKS
J1153-1105. 

We encourage further multi-wavelength coverage. We will continue to monitor
this source and report future developments using this and other platforms.

"
ATEL #12323,Radio,"
The magnetar XTE J1810-197 has experienced periods of activity in X-rays
(Ibrahim et al. 2004) and in radio frequencies, being the first magnetar
in which radio pulsations were detected (Camilo et al. 2006). After being
in a radio-quiet state for several years (Camilo et al. 2016), this magnetar
has recently re-entered in outburst (ATEL #12284, #12285). 

The IAR (Argentinian Institute of Radioastronomy, https://www.iar.unlp.edu.ar/
) is going through major upgrades to suit its two 30-m antennas for pulsar
timing investigations performed by the PuMA (Pulsar Monitoring in Argentina
http://puma.iar.unlp.edu.ar/ ) collaboration. As an exploratory study,
we dedicated observing time to the transient XTE J1810-197 during December
14 (MJD 58466.615), December 19 (MJD 58471.614) and December 20 (MJD 58472.615).
Single-polarization observations with a bandwidth of 56 MHz centered at
1420 MHz revealed significant pulsating radio emission from XTE J1810-197
with a barycentric spin-period of P = 5.54137(3) s on MJD 58466.615, consistent
with the values reported in ATEL #12284, and #12312. In subsequent observations
we obtained signal-to-noise ratios of 16 for a 90-min observation (Antenna
2, Dec. 14), 24 for 150-min observation (Antenna 1, Dec. 19), 10 for a
80-min observation (Antenna 2, Dec. 19) on the first polarization and 14
on the second polarization, and 15 for a 50-min observation (Antenna 2,
Dec. 20). Unfortunately, we could not derive polarization angles and calibrated
fluxes with these measurements. The pulse profiles from Dec. 14 showed
a complex structure of a short, strong peak preluded by a less intense
and longer in duration precursor (<a href=""http://pumacoll.wdfiles.com/local--files/home%3Ahome/magnetar1"">
Dec. 14 pulse profile at 1400 MHz</a>), as reported at other frequencies
in ATEL #12284, #12285, and #12312. In turn, the precursor peak is not
visible on subsequent observations from Dec. 19 (<a href=""http://pumacoll.wdfiles.com/local--files/home%3Ahome/magnetar2"">
Dec. 19 pulse profile at 1400 MHz</a>) and Dec. 20 (  <a href=""http://pumacoll.wdfiles.com/local--files/home%3Ahome/magnetar3"">
Dec. 20 pulse profile at 1400 MHz</a>). 

We will continue performing daily monitoring of the source at 1.4 GHz,
although its proximity to the Sun now forces us to interrupt the follow
up for about ten days.

ATEL #12320,X-ray,"
The MAXI/GSC nova alert system triggered on a bright hard X-ray transient
source at 04:33 UT on December 21, 2018. Assuming that the source flux
was constant over each scan transit at 04:33 and 06:06, we obtain the source
position at

(R.A., Dec) = (247.770 deg, -47.920 deg) = (16 31 04, -47 55 12) (J2000)

with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short
radii of 0.17 deg and 0.17 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long
axis from the north direction is 18.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an
additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius).
The X-ray flux averaged over the scans was 209 +- 27 mCrab (4.0-10.0keV,
1 sigma error).

The error region includes the 1309 second X-ray pulsar AX J1631.9-4752/IGR
J16320-4751 (Sugizaki et al. 2001, ApJS, 134, 77; Rodriguez et al. 2003,
A&A, 407, L41l; Lutovinov et al. 2005, A&A 433, L41). In previous observations,
AX J1631.9-4752 showed hard energy spectra (e.g., Rodriguez et al. 2006,
A&A, 366, 274), but the fluxes were below several tens of mCrab.

The first trigger with the alert system was at 18:25 on December 18, 2018.
At that time, however, the source was near the edge of a detector and it
was difficult to identify the source. The source went into an invisible
sky area soon after that, and entered the field of view again on December
21. An interpolated light curve suggests that the source flux has been
increasing since the first detection. 
On the other hand, the Swift/BAT light curve of AX J1631.9-4752 (https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/AXJ1631.9-4752/)
showed flare-like behavior on December 21.

Because of the brightest outburst never seen before from AX J1631.9-4752,
and relatively poor spatial resolution of MAXI/GSC, we tentatively name
the source MAXI J1631-479. Followup observations are encouraged though
the source is relatively close to the Sun (~ 30 deg).

We report on a new NIR flare of the high redshift QSO (z=1.213) [hb89]0234+285
also known as BZQJ0237+2848, cross-correlated with the radio source 4C+28.07
and the Gamma-ray source 3FGLJ0237.9+2848. On December 20th,2018 MJD(2458472.8246),
we found the source with NIR fluxes corresponding to J = 13.776 +/- 0.03,
H = 12.881 +/- 0.03 and Ks= 12.078 +/- 0.05. On MJD 2458067.65 the flux
in the H band corresponded to H = 14.983 +/- 0.03. Hence, the source has
increased its flux by a factor of 7, in this lapse. The source has shown
flaring activity in the past (see ATel #10034, #11261, #12111) Our observations
are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory
operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics

ATEL #12322,X-ray,"
We report on new X-ray observations of the black hole binary system GX
339-4. GX 339-4 is a prototypical black hole binary with recurring outbursts
every 2-3 years. A significant increase in the radio luminosity has been
recently reported (Tremou et al. 2018, Atel #12287) indicating a new outburst
has started. While monitoring is currently not attainable with most X-ray
instruments due to Sun constrain, observations are possible using the Nuclear
Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR; Harrison et al. 2013, ApJ, 770,
103). Thus, with requested Directors Discretionary Time (DDT), we have
triggered a single ~17.5 ks NuSTAR observation of GX 339-4.  

The observation was performed when the source was roughly 25 degrees away
from the Sun. This reduces the overall astrometric accuracy of NuSTAR as
the star tracker used to reconstruct the source on the sky was blinded
by the Sun. We used a relatively large (100"") extraction region centered
on the apparent position of the source to account for the jitter in the
source location. High level science products (lightcurves, spectra, and
response files) are minimally affected when operating in this mode as long
as the source is bright. 

The source is detected at ~6 counts per second by both Focal Plane Modules
A and B (FPMA/FPMB), well above the background signal in the entire NuSTAR
band (3-79 keV). We measure the source flux at ~2.4e-11 erg/cm^2/s (2-10
keV). The spectra were fitted with an absorbed power-law model (TBabs*pow)
with a fixed hydrogen column density of N_H = 5.e21 cm^-2. We observe a
hard power-law continuum with Gamma = 1.55 +/- 0.01. Clear signatures of
X-ray reprocessing (reflection) are observed in the form of Fe K emission,
Fe K edge, and possibly an excess above ~20 keV due to electron scattering
in the reflection (Compton hump). By fitting the Fe K emission with a Gaussian
profile with fixed width (sigma=0.01 keV), we measure the centroid energy
at E = 6.39 +\- 0.06 keV, and an equivalent width of ~57 eV.  

The hard continuum, flux level, and presence of reflection features are
consistent with the beginning of a new outburst, and show remarkable resemblance
with the last (failed) outburst of this source observed in October 2017-January
2018 (Garcia et al. 2017, Atel #10825), as well as with previous NuSTAR
and Suzaku measurements at similar luminosities (Wang-Ji et al. 2018, ApJ
855, 61, Tomsick et al. 2009, ApJL, 707, 87). 

Given that observations with other X-ray telescopes will not be possible
until middle January 2019, additional NuSTAR DDT observations will be requested
in order to monitor the evolution of this source until the Sun exclusion
period is over. We thank the NuSTAR SOC team for the prompt scheduling
of this observation.

We report on a NIR Flare of the high redshift QSO BZQJ0348-2749 (z=0.991)
cross-identified with the Gamma-ray source 2FGLJ0348.6-2750. On December
19th,2018 (MJD 24578471.7858), we found the source with NIR fluxes J =13.963
+/- 0.05, H = 13.043 +/- 0.05 and Ks = 12.183 +/- 0.05. While on MJD 2458448.799
the flux in the H band corresponded to H = 14.561 +/- 0.04. Hence, the
source has increased its flux by a factor of 4. in this short lapse. The
source is brightest since the time we started monitoring it (MJD 2455459.97),
when the flux in the H band was 15.393 +/- 0.15 Our observations are carried
out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated
by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico),
equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera. We encourage further
multi-wavelength coverage.

We report on high-resolution optical spectroscopy of ASASSN-18abj (AT 2018jro)
which was discovered on 2018-12-12.109 UT by the ASAS-SN survey and confirmed
as a dwarf nova by F. Walter (ATel #12295). 

We obtained two spectra of this object under the SALT Large Science Program
on transients on 2018 December 12.9 and 14.9 UT, using the High Resolution
Spectrograph (HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE, 91476) mounted on the
Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Observations were taken in the
LR mode of HRS, covering a spectral range of 3800-8900 A at a resolution
of R = 14000. The data were reduced with the SALT HRS MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev
et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068). 

The spectra show a blue continuum with relatively strong Halpha, Hbeta,
and relatively weak He I and He II lines in emission (see below a list
of the line identifications). The emission lines are characterised by double
emission peaks (separated by ~ 135 km/s for Hbeta and ~ 100 km/s for Halpha)
and a heliocentric corrected Vr ~ -15 +/- 5 km/s (for the line centre).
We measure a FWZI ~ 450 +/- 20 km/s for Hbeta and ~ 420 km/s for Halpha.
The emission feature of Hbeta is superimposed on a relatively broad absorption
feature (FWZI ~ 2000 +/- 200 km/s). The weak emission features of He I
(4471, 4922, and 5016 A) are also superimposed on a broad emission feature.
In addition broad absorption features of Hgamma and Hdelta are also present.
Overall, the spectrum is typical for a dwarf nova in outburst. 

The EW of the Na I D interstellar absorption doublet is consistent with
low extinction towards the source (Av ~ 0.06), which is considerably lower
than the total reddening value (Av~ 2.6) in this direction from the Galactic
reddening maps by Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011, ApJ, 737, 103). This indicates
that the dwarf nova is nearby, in agreement with the high optical and UV
brightness of the outburst and negligible X-ray extinction (ATel #12294).

Emission line identifications: 
H I (Balmer): 4861 and 6563 A 
He I: 4471, 4922, 5016, 5876, 6678, and 7065 A 
He II: 4686 A

ATEL #12312,Radio,"		Magnetar

Intense radio emission from the magnetar XTE J1810-197 (Gotthelf et al.
2003, 
Ibrahim et al.  2004) has recently been reported in monitoring 
observations with the Lovell radio telescope (Lyne et al. 2018, ATEL 
#12284). These observations have been at higher frequencies 
and subsequent follow-up have detected pulsation at frequencies 
above 835 MHz (Lyne et al. 2018, ATEL #12284; Desvignes et al. 2018, 
ATEL #12285; Lower et al. 2018, ATEL #12288). Although the source is near

Sun, enhanced high energy emission is also indicated in follow up 
observations (Mihara et al. 2018, ATel #12291; Gotthelf et al. 2018, 
ATEL #12297). This is only second such outburst accompanied 
by radio emission from this unique magnetar in last 10 years, during 
which the source was in quiescence state (Camilo et al. 2006; 
Camilo et al. 2016) 

We observed this source for about 40 minutes with the upgraded 
GMRT (Gupta et al. 2018) using a phased array of 19 antennas 
at Band 4 between 550-750 MHz. We recorded the data with 4096 channels

across 200 MHz bandwidth with a sampling time of 1.3 ms. Intense 
single pulses were detected with 35 to 70 signal-to-noise ratio (S/N).

Our best estimate of the period and DM are  5.54156(7) s 
and 181(5) respectively. The average profile with very high S/N of 
about 700 shows two 
distinct components with a large and narrow trailing  component 
following a smaller and wider leading component. The emission 
was seen across the whole band from 550 to 750 MHz. The profile 
evolves across the band with the ratio of peak of trailing 
component to leading component varying from 2.7 to 3 from 550 to 750 
MHz. Our preliminary estimate of the source flux density averaged 
over the full bandwidth is 17(7) mJy. We also notice a significant 
evolution of the flux density across the observed bandwidth.

at frequencies 300-750 MHz using the uGMRT. 

We thank the GMRT staff members for making these 
observations possible at short notice. We are also thankful 
for a prompt allocation of Director's discretionary time for 
these observations.

from 2018 Oct 13.111 UT to 2018 Oct 13.117 UT. The discovery of this supernova
was reported

We report on new Swift observations of the nearby Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC
1566  
which indicate a rebrightening of the AGN in X-rays and the UV. NGC 1566
was discovered in a hard X-ray outburst in June 2018 by INTEGRAL (Ducci
et al., ATel #11754) and Swift follow-up observation showed dramatic increases
in its soft X-ray and UV fluxes as well (Ferrigno et al., ATel #11783;
Kuin et al., ATel #11786; Grupe et al., ATel #11903). We continued monitoring
NGC 1566 and it faded over the following months, reaching a low point by
the end of October. It has steadily become brighter again and in our most
recent Swift observation from 2018-December-18 it had an 0.3-10 keV flux
(5.77+/-0.15)e-14 W/m^2 which corresponds to a count rate of 1.87+/-0.05
counts/s in the Swift XRT. This is a factor of about 3 higher than in October.

In the UVOT all 6 filters were used and we found the following (corrected/uncorrected
for Galactic reddening) Vega magnitudes: V =  13.74/13.74, B = 14.42/14.45,
U = 13.52/13.56, UVW1 = 13.65/13.70, UVM2 = 13.65/13.72, UVW2 = 13.84/13.90.
All magnitudes were determined with a 3"" source extraction radius to avoid
significant contribution by starlight and have an uncertainty of 0.05 magnitudes.
Since the end of October, NGC 1566 has become brighter by about 0.6 magnitudes
in the UV filters.  

We would like to thank Brad Cenko for approving our various ToO requests
and the Swift team for executing our observations. We continue monitoring
this AGN with Swift.

The discovery of the supernova candidate ASASSN-18nt (AT 2018ctv) was reported
by Ping Chen et al (ATel #11762). Subo Dong et al. (ATel #11763) identified
the type, phase, and redshift of the SN using the Low Dispersion Survey
Spectrograph 3 (LDSS3) mounted on the 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope and
concluded that the spectrum of SN2018ctv matches with SN 1991bg-like SNe
Ia near peak and the SN redshift is consistent with that of the Abell 0194
cluster of galaxies (z=0.018). The difference of the INT WFC magnitudes
of SN2018ctv with the measurements close to the peak of the light curve
are also broadly consistent with the light curves of SN 1991bg-like SNe.<br

We report further 1-13 micron infrared spectroscopy of Nova Canis Majoris
(ATel 11565; CBET 4499) obtained with The Aerospace Corporation's Broadband
Array Spectrograph System (BASS) and the Spex instrument on NASA’s IRTF
3-m telescope during the period 2018 December 08 through 10 UT. Earlier
0.47-2.5 micron spectroscopy was obtained on 2018 Oct 20 using the Aerospace
Corporation’s Visible and Near-Infrared Imaging Spectrograph on the 3-m
Shane reflector at the University of California’s Lick Observatory. The
nova’s infrared spectral energy distribution is dominated by a strong
thermal continuum from dust, which exhibits a peak flux of approximately
2 Jy near 5 microns and is well matched by a blackbody of temperature 770
K.  A less certain temperature derived from the October near-infrared data
is 720 K, indicating that the dust has not cooled and has possibly warmed
in the interval.  An additional broad emission bump is detected near 8.1
microns, which resembles unidentified infrared (UIR) features previously
observed in Nova Cassiopeiae 1993 (aka V705 Cas; Evans et al. 2005, MNRAS,
360, 1483) and V2362 Cyg (Lynch et al. 2008, AJ, 136, 1815). The near-infrared
spectrum of the atomic emission lines increased in excitation between the
October and December observations.  He II and Rydberg lines were present
in the former while in the latter, coronal lines, most notably [Si VI]
at 1.9645 microns, have emerged.  Continued monitoring of this infrared-bright
nova is encouraged.

ATEL #12317,Gamma Ray,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope,
has observed an increasing gamma-ray flux from a source positionally consistent
with PMN J0623-3350 (RA = 95.916333 deg, Dec. = -33.837389 deg, J2000;
Healey et al. 2007, ApJS, 171, 61) with no known redshift. 

Preliminary analysis indicates that on December 19, 2018 the source was
in a high state with a gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (0.5 +/- 0.2) x10^-6
ph cm^-2 s^-1, which represents a factor of 5 increase with respect to
the last reported LAT detection of this source in 2013 (Atel# 5668). The
single power-law photon index for this source was 2.2 +/- 0.2. The source
was also detected between December 14-16, 2018 with fluxes (0.4 -- 0.5)
x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1. The gamma-ray source was previously named Fermi
J0623-3351, and subsequently reported as the Fermi-LAT catalog source,
2FAV J0623-33.7 (Abdollahi et al. 2017 ApJ 846, 34). 

Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring
of this source will continue. In consideration of the activity of this
source we strongly encourage multiwavelength observations. The Fermi LAT
contact person for this source is S. Buson (sara.buson at gmail.com). 

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

ATEL #12304,Gamma Ray,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope,
has observed gamma-ray flares from sources positionally consistent with
the flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 0252-549 (RA = 43.3715850 deg, Decl.
= -54.6976208 deg, J2000; Johnston et al. 1995 AJ 110, 880), at redshift,
z=0.54 (Jauncey et al. 1978 ApJ 219, L1), and with the flat spectrum radio
source PMN J2211-7039  (RA = 332.984542 deg, Decl. = -70.653722 deg, J2000;
Mauch et al. 2003 MNRAS 342, 1117), with no known redshift. 

Preliminary analysis indicates that the source coincident with PKS 0252-549
on 2018 Dec 15 and 16 showed a gamma-ray outburst with respective daily
fluxes (E>100MeV) of (0.6 +/- 0.1) x10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 and (0.5 +/- 0.1)
x10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (errors are statistical only), a factor of more than
50x greater than reported in the 3FGL catalog (3FGL J0253.1-5438; Acero
et al. 2015 ApJS 218, 23). The single power-law photon indices were 2.3
+/- 0.2 (Dec 15) and 2.4 +/- 0.2 (Dec 16), and comparable to the 3FGL average
value of 2.45 +/- 0.12. 

For the source coincident with PMN J2211-7039, preliminary analysis on
2018 Dec 16 showed a hard spectrum gamma-ray flare with daily flux (E>100MeV)
of (0.3 +/- 0.1) x10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1, a factor ~20x greater than reported
in the 3FGL catalog (3FGL J2212.3-7039; Acero et al. 2015 ApJS 218, 23).
The single power-law photon index was 1.4 +/- 0.1, significantly smaller
than the 3FGL average value of 2.76 +/- 0.22. High-energy photons with
energy up to 65 GeV were detected. 

Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring
of these sources will continue. In consideration of the activity of these
sources we encourage multiwavelength observations. The Fermi LAT contact
person for these sources is C. C. Cheung (Teddy.Cheung at nrl.navy.mil).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

regular commissioning operations. We report a J-band light curve for the
transient derived from this data. The outburst was clearly detected on
JD 2458461.92 at a J magnitude of 11.01, brightening by more than 2 mags

Cerro Tololo, Chile, we discovered a new transient source, most likely
a supernova, in the galaxy 2MASX J06183926-5428139. 

ASASSN-18abr (AT 2018jwi)  was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-12-14.12

the discovery of the transient. This <a href=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/assassin/followup/asassn-18abr.png>figure</a>
shows the archival DSS image of the host (left) and the confirmation image

from the center of the galaxy 2MASX J06183926-5428139 (z=0.015457, d=65.6

ATEL #12295,Optical,"
The optical transient ASASSN-18abj was reported by R. Fidrich in vsnet-alert
22827. 
On the basis of the large amplitude outburst, 
Fidrich suggested it could be a galactic nova or a nearby CV. 

R. Hinojosa and L. Paredes obtained a spectrum with the SMARTS Chiron 
fiber-fed high resolution spectrograph at 0527UT on 2018 Dec 14. 
The integration time was 10 minutes; the resolution is 27,800.  
The spectrum shown a blue continuum. H&alpha; is in emission 
above the continuum 
with an equivalent width of -3.6&#197; and a full width at zero intensity
of 
9.7&#197;. The central velocity of the line is -12 km/s. The line has a
narrow central reversal with a 
depth of 20% of the emission line intensity. 
The H&beta; line has a centrally-reversed emission reversal (equivalent

width -0.5&#197;); the absorption line FWZI is about 27&#197;.  
H&gamma; and H&delta; are in absorption. There is possible broad He II

&lambda; 4686 emission above the continuum (equivalent  
width -1.5&#197;; the FWHM is about 10&#197;). 

The spectrum is available at the link below. 

ASASSN-18abj is not a galactic nova; the spectrum is that of a dwarf nova
in outburst. 
This is consistent with the conclusion of Sokolosky <em> et al.</em> (ATel
#12294) that the 
transient is nearby.

ATEL #12297,X-ray,"
Based on reports of renewed radio activity from XTE J1810-197 (ATel 
#12284, #12285, #12288), we initiated a NuSTAR Director's 
Discretionary Time observation of the magnetar from UT 2018 Dec 13 
03:59:08 to Dec 13 23:49:24 resulting in 21.9 ks of usable data. A 
bright source was detected with a steady count rate of 4.8 counts/s 
with flux up to at least 30 keV in the hard (3-79 keV) NuSTAR 
bandpass.  The source location is consistent with XTE J1810-197, given

the large coordinate uncertainty (~2') associated with a NuSTAR 
observation close (10 degrees) to the Sun.  The high count rate is 
also consistent with the X-ray flux enhancement for XTE J1810-197 
observed by MAXI/GSC (ATel #12291). A preliminary analysis reveals 
that the spectrum is similar to that found during the discovery 
outburst of 2003 (Ibrahim et al. 2004, ApJ, 609, L21), with a blackbody
temperature 
of kT = 0.73+/-0.01 keV and a non-thermal power-law tail with a steep 
photon index of 4.28+/-0.11.  The absorption column, characterized by 
the TBABS model in XSPEC, is not well-constrained in the NuSTAR 
bandpass and is held fixed in the fit to NH = 1.0E22 cm^-2. The 
absorbed 2-10 keV flux is 2.0E-10 erg/s/cm^2, a factor of 2 greater 
than the 2003 projected maximum outburst flux of (0.8-1.1)E-10 
erg/s/cm^2, determined by fitting an exponential decay model to the 
historic light curve (Gotthelf & Halpern 2007, Ap&SS, 308, 79).  A strong
pulsed 
signal is recovered at a barycentric period of 5.5414468(43) s at MJD 
58465.2, where the uncertainty on the least significant digits, given 
in parentheses, is computed from delta Z^2_1 = -1 from the peak period

in the Z^2_1 periodogram.  
The pulse profile is close to a 
pure sine curve with a pulsed fraction of ~29%, similar in shape to 
that recorded by XMM-Newton during the previous outburst, but less 
modulated. There is no evidence for bursts on second timescales, as

however the chance of catching a burst during the short NuSTAR

We report our last photometric measurement of the blazar S5 0716+714 (RA:
7 21 53.45 Dec: 71 20 36.36 J2000.0) obtained  about two hours ago (Dec
14.72): the source reached the R-band optical magnitude R=12.77(0.01).
The blazar showed frequent and intense optical activity along the last
year (see ATel #11107,#11339,#11676,#11725)  and we are monitoring it from
the Astronomical Observatory of the University of Siena since the unprecedented
flare in VHE gamma rays reported by the MAGIC Collaboration in December
2017 (ATel #11100). This observation was performed within the frame of
a guidance project about astrophysics involving high school students from
the ""Liceo Scientifico A. Poliziano"" (Montepulciano, SI) and ""Liceo Scientifico
Roncalli"" (Poggibonsi, SI).</BR>

Although the source is still far from the brightest R-band optical state
measured along our campaign (R=12.16, ATel #11676), from the brightest
state reported in 2018 (R=11.98, ATel #11725) or from the historical record
(R=11.65, ATel #6953) the doubling of the flux in few days may hint to
a new active phase.</BR>

SN2018ivc was discovered by TNS on 2018/11/24.074 by DLT40.  We report

ATEL #12292,Optical,"
The transient AT 2018fdx (ASASSN-18sk; ATel 11964, 11967) was detected
by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) during observations
of Sector 1. Preliminary photometry was extracted using a 9-pixel aperture
with the transient well separated from the brighter stars in the field.
With a 30-minute cadence, the photometry reveals a complex light curve
consistent with a dwarf nova (DN) outburst. The transient is first detected
on BJD2458345.1 and reaches an initial peak 1.1 days later. The star then
fades by 1.7 mag over 4 days before rising again to a second, brighter
maximum on BJD2458351.5. Rapid variability is seen beginning near the time
of the second maximum. Observations of Sector 1 ended 1.6 days after the
time of the second peak. 

The initial peak is consistent with a normal DN outburst which has nearly
faded away before a superoutburst begins. The rapid variability around
the second peak is likely due to superhump oscillations and we conclude
that AT2018fdx is an SU UMa type DN. A power spectrum of the oscillations
over the first 3 days of the superoutburst gives a superhump period of
2.10 hours. A light curve phased on that period shows that the superhumps
have a total amplitude of 0.3 mag.

ATEL #12293,Optical,"
We report optical photometry of the QSO TXS 0646-176, obtained with the
2.56m Nordic Optical Telescope in La Palma, to look for any enhanced optical
activity associated with a recent flare in the daily averaged gamma-ray
flux (ATel#12252). 

These NOT observations were made using the ALFOSC (Alhambra Faint Object
Spectrograph and Camera) instrument at the epoch 2018-12-09T01:24. Standard
IRAF data reduction (de-biasing + flat field correction with twilight flats)
was carried out and differential photometry was performed. The brightness
was calibrated against 54 
SDSS field stars near the target. The std-dev of the zero point was 0.04
mag. 

We find that TXS 0646-176 had an SDSS r-magnitude = 17.45+/-0.04 (AB-system).
This result suggests that there is significant enhancement in its optical
magnitude. For example, an historic value of this object's r-magnitude
from PanSTARRS at mean epoch 09-31-2013 is 19.0835 (Chambers et al. 2016,
arXiv:1612.05560). It has reported SDSS magnitudes of 18.82 and 18.58 in
DR8 (Aihara et al. 2011, ApJS, 193, 29) and 18.84 in DR7 (Abazajian et
al. 2009, ApJS, 182, 543). The source has GSC2.3 F (Rmag ) of 19.1. 

We encourage further multi-wavelength coverage. We will continue to monitor
this source and report future developments using this and other platforms.

ATEL #12294,Optical,"		Transient, Variables

The g=11.2 optical transient ASASSN-18abj (AT 2018jro) was  
discovered on 2018-12-12.109 UT by the ASAS-SN survey and reported  
to the Transient Name Server. R. Fidrich confirmed the object on  
2018-12-12.292 UT at V=10.8 (vsnet-alert 22827). T. Vanmunster  
found fast irregular variability with ~0.05mag amplitude based  
on a 3.6hr-long time series (vsnet-alert 22828).  

We observed ASASSN-18abj with Swift for 2 ks on 2018-12-13.363 UT.  
Swift/XRT detected a bright (0.101 +/-0.007 cts/s) X-ray source at  
the position of the transient. The source spectrum is soft implying  
negligible Galactic absorption and can be fit by the thermal  
plasma model (APEC) with kT=10 +/-5 keV. The power-law model with  
the photon index of 1.5 +/-0.1 also provides an acceptable fit.  
The integrated 0.3-10 keV fluxes are (4.0 +/-0.4)x10^-12 and  
(4.2 +/-0.4)x10^-12 ergs/cm^2/s for the APEC and power-law models,  
respectively. Introducing an absorption component with free n_H1  
into the model results in n_H1<10^21 cm^-2, consistent with zero  
within the uncertainties. The source is saturated in the UVOT  
ultraviolet image suggesting its magnitude UVW2<11 (Vega system).  

The total Galactic absorbing column in the direction of this source  
is n_H1 = 5.33x10^21 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005 A&A, 440, 775)  
and the optical extinction is E(B-V)=0.824 (Schlafly & Finkbeiner  
2011, ApJ, 737, 103), implying a UVW2 band extinction of 6.8mag  
(Roming et al. 2009, ApJ, 690, 163). Both the absence of detectable  
X-ray absorption and UV brightness of the source suggest that  
ASASSN-18abj is nearby, foreground to much of the Galactic column.  
Therefore, this object is unlikely to be a classical nova but may  
be a high-amplitude, WZ Sge-type, dwarf nova, perhaps similar to,  
but more distant than, GW Lib (Hiroi et al. 2009 PASJ, 61, 697 and  
Byckling et al. 2009, MNRAS, 399, 1567). Spectroscopic observations  
are needed to test this hypothesis.  

We thank the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory team and PI, Brad Cenko,  
for rapid scheduling of this ToO observation.

ATEL #12291,X-ray,"
MAXI team noticed an X-ray enhancement at around (272.6, -19.6) on December
8, 2018.  
According to ATel #12284, #12285, and #12288, the agreement of the position

and the start days of activity suggests that the X-ray would come from
XTE J1810-197. 
The MAXI light curve of XTE J1810-197 is shown in http://maxi.riken.jp/plot/XTEJ1810-197.png

Positive X-ray from this region has been detected since 58450 MJD (Nov.28),
while 
the last non-detection was on 58439 MJD (Nov.17) before the observation
gap.  

The flux in 58450 (Nov.28) - 58458 (Dec.6) MJD was almost flat with 0.016
c/s/cm2 in 2-4 keV. 
No burst was observed. 
The spectrum was well fit by a blackbody with kT = 0.90 +- 0.13 keV  
without inter-stellar absorption. 
The flux was (2.9 +- 0.3) x 10^-10 erg/s/cm2 (2-10 keV).   
The powerlaw model fits a little worse with the photon index = 2.7 +- 0.4.

Although MAXI coverage in 58459 (Dec.7) - 58465 (Dec.13) were not complete,

the light curves looks constant in MAXI HP :  
http://maxi.riken.jp/star_data/J1809-197/J1809-197.html 

Although XTE J1810-197 is close to the sun now, detailed observation with

ATEL #12288,Radio,"
Following the reported radio revival of the magnetar XTE J1810-197 (ATel
#12284) and subsequent detection at high-frequencies (ATel #12285), we
conducted low-frequency observations of the pulsar with the 1.6km Molonglo
Observatory Synthesis Telescope as part of the UTMOST project (Bailes et
al. 2017). 

A single 20 minute observation was performed at 835 MHz with 31 MHz of
bandwidth at 02:38:32 UTC on December 12, 2018 (MJD 58464.11). The pulsar
was tracked using a tied array beam as it transited through the Molonglo
primary beam, resulting in a final integrated signal-to-noise ratio of
46.1. Throughout the observation we detected a number of bright single
pulses, many with individual signal-to-noise ratios in excess of 7. 

Using the pulsars PSR J1903+0135 and PSR J1644-4559 as references, we estimate
the flux density at 835 MHz of XTE J1810-197 to be 9 +/- 4 mJy. 

We will continue to regularly monitor this magnetar with UTMOST on a daily
to weekly cadence.

As part of the ThunderKAT Large Survey Programme (Fender et al.2017, arXiv:1711.04132),
the recurrent black hole transient GX 339-4 is observed regularly (on
a weekly basis, usually on week-end) with the new MeerKAT radio telescope.
Between September 2018 - 24 November 2018 the source remained in quiescence
indicating a flux density upper limit <100uJy. The last MeerKAT observations
showed that GX 339-4 is starting a new outburst.  We report on the fluxes
of three observing epochs, 0.25h each. Observations on 2018-11-24 10:18
(60 antennas) reveal a detection of a point source at the position of GX
339-4 with flux density 439+/-7 uJy.  On 2018-12-02 09:44  (62 antennas),
the source shows an increase in flux density to 868+/-19 uJy and on 2018-12-08
09:18 (63 antennas) the flux density of GX 339-4 is 1631+/-12 uJy. All
observations were taken at a central frequency of 1.284 GHz with a total
bandwidth of 860MHz. GX 339-4 shows a recurrent outburst activity (Corbel
et al. 2013, MNRAS, 428, 2500), which makes it an ideal target to study
the correlation of radio and X-ray luminosities, highlighting the disk
to outflows connection. Although, X-ray observations are currently not
feasible due to sun constraints, radio observations will help us to cover
the initial phase of the outburst. Further monitoring is ongoing.  

ThunderKAT will run for 5 years and aims to monitor all bright, active,
southern hemisphere X-ray binaries in the radio band. For further information
on this programme please contact Rob Fender and/or Patrick Woudt.  

We thank the staff at the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO)
for scheduling these observations. The MeerKAT telescope is operated by
SARAO, which is a facility of the National Research Foundation, an agency

The magnetar XTE J1810-197, discovered following an X-ray outburst in 2003
(Ibrahim et al. 2004), was the first magnetar to have detected radio pulsations
(Camilo et al. 2006). The onset of the radio emission appeared to be connected
with the X-ray outburst. As the X-ray flux decayed over time (Bernardini
et al. 2011), so did the radio flux until late 2008, when the source was
no longer visible at radio frequencies (Camilo et al. 2016).  

We are regularly monitoring XTE J1810-197 with the 76-m Lovell Telescope
at Jodrell Bank Observatory. After 10 years in this quiescent state, intense
radio emission from XTE J1810-197 was observed to have resumed on 2018
December 8 (MJD 58460.6), with a signal to noise ratio of over 400 in a
30-minute observation with a 384-MHz wide band centered at 1532 MHz. The
spin-period measured over the two days following the re-detection observation
(P = 5.5414391(1) s on MJD 58461.5) is somewhat smaller than value (P =
5.541463 s) obtained from a 460-day extrapolation of the ephemeris derived
from XMM-Newton, Chandra and NICER data (Pintore et al. 2018). The pulse
shape is not dissimilar to shapes observed during some phases of the previous
outburst at the same frequency.  

Our last non-detection of the source was observed on 2018 October 26 (MJD
58417), with the Lovell Telescope. XTE J1810-197 was also monitored at
higher frequencies with the 100-m Effelsberg Radio Telescope since early
2018, using the new C-X band receiver (4-8 GHz). The latest observation
was collected on September 10 (MJD 58371) and no detection was made. Additional
observations are now planned. We find no reports of increased X-ray emission
of the source, although X-ray observations are currently restricted by
the proximity of the source's line of sight to the Sun. We continue to
monitor the emission from XTE J1810-197 in its newly re-activated phase
and we encourage observation at X-ray energies and at other radio frequencies.

Following a report of bright radio flaring of the magnetar XTE J1809-197
detected with the 76-m Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank (Atel #12284),
observations of this neutron star were conducted with the 100-m Effelsberg
radio telescope of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. Two consecutive
observations, each lasting about 20 minutes and utilizing receivers operating
at 4.74 GHz and 8.35 GHz with 500 MHz bandwidth, were initiated on December
11th 2018, 13h17 UTC  (MJD 58463.5). 

The data were folded in real-time using a rotational period as predicted
by the Jodrell Bank observations (Atel #12284). Highly significant detections
have been made at each frequency with  measured average flux densities
of 22.5+/-0.2 mJy at 4.74 GHz and 14.9+/-0.2 mJy at 8.35 GHz, giving a
spectral index of -0.7. Evidence for bright single pulse emission is present
throughout each of the 20-min integrations. 

The average pulse profiles have changed morphology since earlier observations
at similar frequencies, and no longer exhibit signs of interpulse emission
(Lazaridis et al. 2008). Some frequency evolution in profile shape is observed
in this data. Consistent with other radio magnetars, the pulse profiles
are nearly 100% linearly polarised (e.g. ATel #5064) and exhibit about
10 per cent circular polarisation. The polarisation angle of the linear
polarisation show a clear swing at each frequency.

Continued radio monitoring has started and higher frequency observations
are scheduled.

We report a new redshift value of 0.0179 &plusmn; 0.0003 for SN2018ilu,
this redshift was obtained from narrow and spatially extended Halpha emission
coincident with the position of the host of SN2018ilu. The observations
we were performed on the night of 2018 November 30 at the 4.1-m SOAR telescope
equipped with the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph using the 400 lines/mm
grating, and a slit width of 1.0 arc second. From the 2D spectrum, we find
that the peak of the Halpha emission is located 9.87 arc seconds to the
north-west of the SN position, at a projected distance of about 3.6 kpc
at the redshift of the SN. The previous value reported by Berton et al.
2018 in ATel #12216 was obtained by fitting spectral templates to the classification
spectrum, the template method yields more uncertain redshift values, particularly
at early phases when the spectral diversity is large. The value reported
here makes more consistent the spectral and photometric evolution of SN2018ilu
with a bright but normal SN Ia.

Following the discovery of the soft X-ray transient MAXI J1810-222 (Negoro
et al. ATel #12254; Maruyama et al. #12264), we requested NuSTAR ToO observations.
From 08:57 to 20:20 on 2018 December 9, NuSTAR performed mosaic 5x5 observations,
approximately 600 sec each. It covered a 52'x52' region centering at (R.A.,
Dec) =(273.006, -22.418), which was obtained from the latest MAXI data
at that time. 

NuSTAR FPMA and FPMB clearly detected a source at the position (R.A., Dec)
= (273.1226, -22.3274) with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin.  
In the observations, the optical star camera used for aspect reconstruction
was unavailable because of the proximity to the Sun, resulting in the relatively
large errors. This position is within the MAXI error region above, but
outside of the refined position (ATel #12264). We note that there is no
known X-ray source within the error region.

The preliminary analysis shows a steep energy spectrum with no apparent
hard tail. The 3-10 keV spectrum is represented by a power-law with a photon
index of 5.5 +/- 0.3, or a blackbody or disk blackbody model with 0.6-0.7
keV. The 4-10 keV flux was 1.3e-11 erg/s. These are consistent with a recent
MAXI/GSC spectrum. The nature of the source is still unknown.

A further deep NuSTAR observation will be carried out, followup observations,
e.g., in the radio band, are highly encouraged to reveal this peculiar
soft X-ray transient.

Notes: 
When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from the
SN spectrum.  Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy.

(1) The spectrum has some similarities to SNe IIb at early phases.  There
is a strong absorption feature at ~6150 A, which could be Si II or high-velocity
H alpha.  If the latter, it corresponds to a velocity of -19,000 km/s.

(2) Good match to a normal SN Ia near peak.  The SN has a faint host galaxy
with r_PS1 = 21.7 mag.  At z = 0.03, this corresponds to a stellar mass
of ~10^7 M_sun, making it one of the least-massive SN Ia host galaxies
yet (see e.g., Brown et al., arxiv:1810.00011).

ATEL #12277,Gamma Ray,"		Blazar, Quasar

The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed increasing gamma-ray emission from a source
positionally consistent with the flat spectrum radio quasar object OQ 334
(also known as B2 1420+32, GB2 1420+326 and 3FGL J1422.4+3227) with radio
coordinates (J2000) R.A.: 215.626579deg, Dec.: 32.386233deg (Petrov & Taylor
2011, AJ, 142, 89). This blazar has a redshift z=0.6819 (Hewett & Wild
2010, MNRAS, 405, 2302). 

OQ 334 (B2 1420+32) has brightened in GeV gamma rays since 2018 December
5. In particular, preliminary analysis indicates that on 2018 December
7, OQ 334 was in a high state with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100
MeV) of (1.3+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty
only), almost 180 times greater than its four-year average flux reported
in the third Fermi-LAT source catalog (3FGL, Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218,
23). The corresponding single power-law photon spectral index (E>100 MeV)
of 1.8+/-0.1 (statistical uncertainty only) is smaller (i.e. harder spectrum)
than the 3FGL catalog value of 2.56+/-0.21. 

The peak 6-hour integrated gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (2.5+/-0.5) X
10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 was reached by OQ 334 on 2018 December 7 in the
interval 00:00-06:00 UT, and was about 340 times greater than the average
flux reported in the 3FGL catalog. 

This is the first time that an increasing gamma-ray flux trend for this
source is announced with a telegram by the Fermi LAT Collaboration after
more than 10 years of Fermi LAT all-sky survey observations. The source
will be inserted in the ""<a href=""https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/"">LAT
Monitored Sources</a>"" table at FSSC, and consequently preliminary estimations
of the daily and weekly gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi LAT will be publicly
available. 

Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring
of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity
of this source, we encourage multiwavelength observations. For this source
the Fermi LAT contact person is S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini@ssdc.asi.it).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

ATEL #12278,Optical,"
Following the announcement of a Gamma Ray high state of PKS2134-004 (OX
057) in ATel #12273 by S. Ciprini and S. Buson, I have observed the source
on 2018-12-08.75 with the 30cm telescope of the Foligno Observatory (IAU
K56). Comparison stars were taken from the UCAC4 catalog and aperture photometry
was made with IRAF/apphot: the source was detected at V=16.9 +-0.08. The
magnitude of this FSRQ in the recent Gaia DR2 catalog is G=16.6, consistent
with our value given the different passbands. A similar value is reported
in the older GSC2.3.2 catalog (V=16.5). Apparently the enhancement in Gamma-ray
flux is not related to the optical one, at variance with the majority of
blazars.

"
ATEL #12273,Gamma Ray,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed increasing gamma-ray activity from a source
positionally consistent with the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 2134+004
(also known as OX 057 and DA 553) with radio coordinates (J2000) R.A.:
324.160776 deg, Dec.: 0.698392deg, (Johnston 1995, AJ, 110, 880) and with
redshift z=1.944603 (Hewett et al., 2010, MNRAS, 405, 2302). This source
is not in any published LAT catalog and was not detected by AGILE or EGRET.

Preliminary analysis indicates that PKS 2134+004 was detected with high
confidence by the Fermi-LAT in the past ten days (2018-Nov-26 / 2018-Dec-06),
at an average flux of (6.3 +/- 0.6) X 10^-7 photons cm^-2 s^-1. On 2018
December 4, the source reached a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV)
of (1.5+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 with a single power-law photon
index of 2.4+/-0.2 (statistical uncertainty only). PKS 2134+004 continued
to be detected on a daily basis on 2018 December 5 and 6 with daily averaged
gamma-ray fluxes (E>100 MeV) respectively of (1.3+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons
cm^-2 s^-1 and (1.2+/-0.3) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1. The corresponding
photon spectral indexes (E>100 MeV) of 2.3+/-0.2 and 2.4+/-0.2 suggest
a rather stable spectral state during the current flaring state. 

Because this is a new detection of this source, we strongly encourage further
multifrequency observations of this object. Since Fermi normally operates
in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this source will continue.
PKS 2134+004 is being added to the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently
a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi-LAT
will be publicly available (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/).
The Fermi-LAT contact person for this source are S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini
at ssdc.asi.it) and S. Buson (sara.buson at astro.uni-wuerzburg.de). 

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

ATEL #12274,Neutrinos,"
Using online data from the ANTARES detector, we searched for muon neutrino
events originating from the location of TXS 0506+056 over a 10-day time
window (2018-11-27 00:00:00 UTC to 2018-12-07 00:00:00 UTC) including the
gamma-ray flare period observed by MAGIC (ATel #12260) and the time period
probed by IceCube (ATel #12267).The search was done in the sample of reconstructed
tracks of particles propagating upward from below the horizon. No candidate
events were recorded within three degrees of the blazar coordinates during
this period. This yields a preliminary 90% confidence level upper limit
on the muon-neutrino fluence from a point source of 4.5 GeV.cm^-2 over
the energy range 4.7 TeV - 4.1 PeV (the range corresponding to 5-95% of
the detectable flux) for an E^-2 power-law spectrum.  

ANTARES is the largest neutrino detector installed in the Mediterranean
Sea, and is primarily sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV
energy range. At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos
is below 0.5 degrees.

"
ATEL #12271,Radio,"
We observed the field of the TDE candidate AT2018HCO (ATel #12263, TNS
Report No. 23352)  with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA;
Zwart et al. 2008; Hickish et al. 2018) at 15.5 GHz on 2018-12-03.8 for
4 hours. The custom pipeline REDUCE_DC (e.g. Perrott et al. 2015) was used
to calibrate and flag the data, with 3C286 as the absolute flux calibrator
and J0112+2244 as the interleaved phase calibrator. 

We do not detect a source at the phase center, and we set a 3-sigma upper
limit of ~80 uJy. 

We plan to continue monitoring this source and would like to thank the
MRAO staff for carrying out these observations.

Since April 2016, some 10 neutrino Icecube events have been made public

(see https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/amon_hese_events.html and https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/amon_ehe_events.html
). The AGILE team embarked in a search for transient gamma-ray sources
(>100 MeV) temporally and spatially coincident with these neutrino events
and found 3 gamma-ray sources coincident with them (Lucarelli et al., 2018).

For one of these sources (B), we recently (March 2018) obtained an optical
spectrum of the most interesting counterpart, the HSP blazar 2WHSP J062753.2-151956
(Chang et al., 2017) which is associated to the Fermi gamma-ray source
3FGLJ0627.9-1517.  
The spectrum of this object (g = 19.4) was obtained at the 10.4m Gran Telescopio
Canarias using OSIRIS (exposure time = 6000 sec and spectral range = 4100-7700
Ang). The spectrum is characterized by the combination of a power-law emission
and starlight from host galaxy typical of BL Lac object of low nucleus-to-host
ratio. We clearly detect absorption features due to CaII doublet, G-band,
and H_beta  at z= 0.3102. The spectrum is reported in our online ZBLLac
database (http://archive.oapd.inaf.it/zbllac/). 
At this redshift the AGILE gamma-ray luminosity is ~2x10^46 erg s-1, comparable
to that of TXS0506+056 (AGILE source C).

We report on a NIR rebrightening of the radio source NVSSJ020344+304238,
cross-identified with the high redshift quasar BZBJ0203+3042 (z=0.761)
and tentatively with the Gamma-ray source 3FGLJ0203.6+3043. We have reobserved
the source in the NIR, finding that on November 29th,2018 (MJD 2458451.9049)
its H-band flux corresponded to H = 15.046 +/- 0.03. This flux in H is
2 times higher than the previously determined value by our team (H = 15.799
+/- 0.06 on MJD 2458146.6133). In the past, the source has presented flaring
activity in the NIR (see ATEL#11215). Our observations are carried out
with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated by the
National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico), equipped
with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera. We encourage further multi wavelength
coverage.

ATEL #12263,Radio,"		Transient, Tidal Disruption Event

The source AT2018hco was discovered by ATLAS on 2018-Oct-04 and reported
to TNS on 2018-Oct-05. The source was also detected on the rise in ZTF
partnership data, with a first detection on 2018-Sep-18. The fading part
of the light curve, which is part of public ZTF MSIP data and reported
to TNS on 2018-Nov-04, shows a blue and constant color (g-r ~ -0.1).  

We report the classification of AT2018hco based on Swift/UVOT and ground-based
spectroscopic follow-up observations. Our SEDM (Blagorodnova, PASP, 130,
2018) spectrum, obtained 2018-Oct-26, showed a blue continuum with no significant
emission lines. Follow-up spectroscopy with Keck/LRIS, obtained 2018-Dec-1,
showed broad Halpha emission and broad He I (5876) emission. From Ca H,
and K absorption we determine a redshift of z~0.09.  

We requested Swift observations on 2018-Nov-15. These were obtained on
2018-Nov-29 and showed the transient is UV-bright. We measure UVW2=18.67
+/- 0.07 (AB), implying a blue UV-optical color: UVW2-g ~ 0. The source
is not detected in XRT.  

The TDE classification is based on the location in the center of the host
galaxy (offset 0.1 +/- 0.1 arcsec), blue and constant color post peak,
the detection of broad H and He in the optical spectrum, and finally the
UV detection in Swift/UVOT. The source shows no prior variability in ZTF,
PTF, or CRTS data. The W1-W2 color, based on unWISE forced photometry (Lang
2014 arXiv:1410.7397), is 0.07 +/- 0.09, indicating a quiescent host galaxy.

Follow-up with VLA, AMI, XMM, and Spitzer has been triggered. We encourage
further follow-up of this source, in particular spectroscopic monitoring
and multi-band imaging. 

ZTF is a project led by PI S. R. Kulkarni at Caltech (see ATEL #11266),

ATEL #12264,X-ray,"
We further report analysis results using MAXI/GSC data of the newly discovered
soft X-ray transient MAXI J1810-222 (Negoro et al. ATel #12254).

Longterm GSC light curves show that the 2-4 keV X-ray flux has gradually
increased since the beginning of November (~ MJD 58425) except for the
period from November 18 to 27 when MAXI could not observe the region, and
that the 4-10 keV X-ray flux shows slight excess of 0.0034 +/- 0.0023 c/cm^2/s
(~ 3 mCrab) only from MJD 58420 to 58430. On December 2 (MJD 58454), the
2-4 keV and 4-10 keV fluxes changed from  0.027 +/- 0.004 c/cm^2/s (on
December 1) to 0.014 +/- 0.004 c/cm^2/s, and from 0.002 +/- 0.004 c/cm^2/s
to 0.007 +/- 0.004 c/cm^2/s, respectively, which may indicate the source
is undergoing some transition. 

The time averaged energy spectrum obtained on November 29-31 is well represented
by a blackbody model with a temperature of 0.36 (+0.10, -0.08) keV, or
by an absorbed blackbody model with a temperate of 0.34 (+0.09, -0.08)
keV and a fixed column density to the direction of 6.36e-21 atoms/cm^2
obtained at HEASARC (https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Tools/w3nh/w3nh.pl).
The flux and unabsorbed flux of the above models are 2.2e-10 erg/cm^2/s
in the 2-10 keV band in both case, and 1.29e-9 and 0.92e-9 erg/cm^2/s,
respectively, in the 0.8-60 keV band. The size of the emission region,
the blackbody radius, is hardly constrained, but the best-fit parameters
show the radii of 80 (d/10 kpc) km and 100 (d/10kpc) km for the models,
respectively. Optically thin thermal plasma models with kT ~ 0.7-0.8 keV
also represent the observed spectrum. The 90% upper-limit of the 4-20 keV
flux is 1.5e-11 erg/cm^2/s if we assume the power-law model with a photon
index of 1.

We also obtained the refined position of the source using 15 scan data
from 22:15 on November 30 to 20:34 on December 1: 

(R.A., Dec) = (272.634 deg, -22.309 deg) = (18 10 32, -22 18 32) (J2000)

with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short
radii of 0.27 deg and 0.21 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long
axis from the north direction is 101.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an
additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius).

Similar soft X-ray spectra were obtained in Aql X-1 with a luminosity of
less than 5e35 erg/s at 0.8-100 keV (Sakurai et al. 2014, PASJ, 66, 10,
also see MAXI J1807+132, Shidatsu et al. 2017, ApJ, 850, 115). If this
is the case, the source distance becomes less than 1.9 kpc. A (massive)
black hole binary in the soft state at a distance of, say, ~10 kpc might
also be possible. However, in both cases, a hard power-law or tail component
must be present, which is not confirmed, yet. Some magnetars also exhibit
such a soft thermal component with kT ~ 0.5 keV (e.g., Enoto et al. 2017,
ApJS, 231, 8, and references therein). In such case, the source distance
must be ~1 kpc from the blackbody radius, and a hard-tail is also expected.
Finally, we note that these is a possibility of a new type of X-ray star
because MAXI has not detected such a long-lived, soft X-ray transient without
seeing a hard state.

Followup observations especially in the hard X-ray band to detect a hard
tail are encouraged to reveal the nature of the source.

(1)  The spectrum of SN2018jhf is consistent either with a SN Ia (91T-like)
or SN Ic, both before maximum. It shows clear Halpha and [S II] lines.
By comparing the SN and the host galaxy spectra, we conclude that these
emission lines are from a HII region of the host. The light curve of SN2018jhf
had a fast rise of 1.5 mag in 2 days. The last non-detection was 12 days
before our spectral observations, suggesting that the luminosity will continue
increasing for a few more days. Adopting a standard cosmology with H0 =
70 km/s/Mpc, we obtain a distance modulus of 37.1 mag. This gives a current
absolute magnitude of about -19.1. Taking into account this previous analysis,
the object could reach a peak absolute magnitude of around -20 mag, being
too high for both SN 91T-like and Ic. This picture could be explained by
a superchandra scenario. A new spectrum will be necessary to help to clarify
the spectral type.

The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports: 

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events arriving
from the position of TXS 0506+056 over the time window of one week (2018-11-27
00:00:00 UTC to 2018-12-04 00:00:00 UTC) motivated by recent MAGIC observations
(http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=12260). One track-like event
is found in spatial coincidence with TXS 0506+056, consistent with the
atmospheric background expectation, and resulting in a p-value of 1.0.
Accordingly, we set a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux normalization
upper limit of 4.12 x 10^-5 TeV cm^-2  at the 90% CL for this observation
period, assuming an E^-2 spectrum in an approximate energy range of 1 TeV
to 1 PeV (E^2 dN/dE).

The type II SN 2018hna (TNS #30529) was discovered on 2018-10-22 21:17:49
(UTC) by K. Itagaki.  
Photometric observations were made beginning 35 days later on 2018-11-16
15:36:00 (UTC) by the ATLAS twin 0.5m telescope system on Haleakala and
Mauna Loa (Tonry et al. 2018, PASP, 13, 064505), and have shown that the
light curve is still rising. The latest ATLAS o-band measurement, from
2018-11-28 15:50:24 (UTC), is ~14.8 mag (absolute magnitude ~ -15 mag).

The long rise is ongoing, and can be seen in the public Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF) light curve on the Lasair broker (https://lasair.roe.ac.uk/object/ZTF18acbwaxk).

We also observed SN 2018hna on 2018-11-30 05:56:21 (UTC) using SPRAT (Piascik
et al 2014) on the Liverpool Telescope (Steele et al. 2004). The appearance
of the spectrum and the measured line velocities are commensurate with
normal SNe II. 

To summarise, the SN is spectroscopically normal but has a low absolute
magnitude and long rise time, it is hosted in a faint dwarf galaxy which
is possibly metal poor. Given the unusual nature of this object, we encourage
follow-up observations.

neutrino event IceCube-170922A (ATel #10791).  
On Dec 3rd 2018 the MAGIC telescopes observed this source for about 2 hours
under good weather conditions.  
The source was detected at VHE gamma-rays above 90 GeV with a significance
larger than 5 sigma. The preliminary analysis yields an estimate of the
VHE gamma-ray flux above 90 GeV of ~10-15% of the flux from the Crab Nebula
above the same energy threshold, and a spectral index of ~4.  
This flux is consistent with the emission level integrated between September
28th 2017 to October 3rd 2017, when the source was discovered at VHE gamma-rays
(ATel #10817).  
The MAGIC telescopes will continue monitoring the VHE gamma-ray emission

ATEL #12256,Optical,"
We report on the possible supernova in IRAS 07171-6832 = 2MASX J07170471-6837420
galaxy. The new object was discovered on the unfiltered images of the field
centered at NGC 2397 obtained remotely with iTelescope.Net T31 instrument
(0.50-m f/6.8 reflector + CCD) at Siding Spring on 2018 Dec. 01 at 16:04-16:08
UT. Since the object was located near the edge of 56'x56' T31 FOV, the
additional confirmation images were taken on 2018-12-01 at 16:33-16:37
UT with the OT position at the center. The object is detected on both stacked
images (3x60-sec exposures each) with the unfiltered magnitude of 17.1m.
The OT position (J2000.0): R.A. = 07 17 04.32, Decl. = -68 37 37.3 which
is 2"" west and 5"" north of the center of the host galaxy. 

The galaxy is not present in NGC, PGC or ESO catalogs, despite being listed
in USNO-A2.0 with ID 0150-04767427 (Bmag=10.3, Rmag=10.5) and GSC 09179-01270
(Pmag=11.42). 2MASS extended sources catalogue (IPAC/UMass, 2003-2006)
provides the following magnitudes: J=12.83+/-0.05, H=12.26+/-0.07, K=12.03+/-0.11.
Imperial IRAS-FSC redshift catalogue (Wang et al., 2009) gives the value
of z=0.0214 for IRAS F07171-6832. Color-combined (JRIR) image of the host
galaxy is uploaded to http://scan.sai.msu.ru/~denis/SN/IRAS07171-6832-JRIR.jpg
(10'x10' FOV). The confirmation iTelescope T31 image is posted at the Transient
Name Server page of AT 2018jgq. 

The possible supernova was discovered during the after school astronomy
classes at the Education Center on Donskaya (DNTTM). This is our first
PSN discovery in 3 years of using the iTelescope instruments. Spectral
confirmation is very welcome.

ATEL #12254,X-ray,"
We report the MAXI/GSC detection of a soft X-ray transient MAXI J1820-222.
The source is seen on GSC images at least on 29th and 30th November 2018
only in the 2-4 keV band. The 2-4 keV X-ray flux is about 20-40 mCrab.
No significant time variations are recognized.

Assuming that the source flux was constant over the transit, we obtain
the source position at

(R.A., Dec) = (272.732 deg, -22.280 deg) = (18 10 55, -22 16 48) (J2000)

with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short
radii of 0.32 deg and 0.26 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long
axis from the north direction is 108.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an
additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius).

There is no bright catalogued X-ray source in the error region except for
a few ROSAT X-ray sources, e.g., 1RXS J181011.5-222515 (13.3 arcmin apart),
1RXS J181026.5-223424 (18.9 arcmin). This transient has an unusually soft
X-ray spectrum and a duration of more than 1 day, suggesting that the source
is a LMXB hosting a neutron star or black hole in the soft state. Other
possibilities, however, can not be excluded, and we tentatively name the
source MAXI J1810-222. 

Followup observations are strongly encouraged though the source is currently
close to the sun (~25 deg).

ATEL #12252,Gamma Ray,"		Blazar, Quasar, Gravitational Lensing

The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of the two instruments on the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed increasing gamma-ray flux from
a source positionally consistent with PKS 1830-211, also known as 3FGL
J1833.6-2103 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23) with radio coordinates
(J2000) R.A.: 278.416201 deg, Dec.: -21.061048 deg (van Ommen et al., 1995,
ApJ, 444, 561). 
PKS 1830-211 is a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) placed at redshift
z=2.507 (Lovell et al. 1998, ApJ, 508, L51), having intervening absorption
systems and being subject to gravitational lensing by a galaxy at z=0.886
(Wiklind & Combes 1996, Nature, 379, 11). In the past PKS 1830-211 showed
major GeV gamma-ray outburst activity in 2010 (Abdo et al. 2015, ApJ, 799,
143). 

PKS 1830-211 has been recently bright in GeV gamma rays for several months,
and was reported last October in ATel#12136 by the Fermi LAT Collaboration.
Preliminary analysis indicates that on 2018 November 29, the prolonged
outburst of this source further increased, reaching a daily averaged gamma-ray
flux (E>100 MeV) of (4.2+/-0.6)X10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty
only), with corresponding photon spectral index (E>100 MeV) of 2.3+/-0.2.
The gamma-ray flux was  above the 3.0X10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 level the
previous three days (Nov. 26, 27 and 28)  as well. GeV gamma-ray activity
of PKS 1830-211 has been announced four times since 2009 by the Fermi LAT
Collaboration (ATel#12136, ATel#6361, ATel#4158, ATel#2943) and two times
by the AGILE Collaboration (ATel#2242, ATel#2950). 

Also on  2018 November 29 the LAT observed increasing gamma-ray flux from
a source positionally consistent with TXS 0646-176, also known as 3FGL
J0648.8-1740, with radio coordinates (J2000) R.A.: 102.118744 deg, Dec.:-17.734844
deg (Petrov et al. 2006, AJ, 131, 1872), and redshift z=1.232 (Hewitt &
Burbidge 1993, ApJS, 87, 451). 

Preliminary analysis indicates that TXS 0646-176 on November 29 reached
a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (1.5+/-0.1)X10^-6 photons
cm^-2 s^-1, with corresponding photon spectral index (E>100 MeV) of 2.4+/-0.1.
GeV gamma-ray activity of TXS 0646-176 has been announced on two previous
occasions by the Fermi LAT Collaboration. 

Both the sources are included in the list of publicly monitored sources,
with their preliminary light curves that can be found at <a href=""https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/"">FSSC</a>

Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring
of these sources will continue. In consideration of their ongoing activity
we strongly encourage multiwavelength observations. For both the sources
the Fermi LAT contact person is S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini@ssdc.asi.it).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan, and Sweden.

ATEL #12246,Optical,"
We report spectroscopic observations of optical transients ASASSN-18zz
(ATel #12228), ASASSN-18zp (ATel #12194) and ATLAS18yik using SALT/RSS
(350.0-920.0 nm). The target was discovered by All-Sky Automated Survey
for Supernovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014) and ATLAS survey (Tonry et
al. 2011 and Tonry et al. ATel #8680). We used SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007,
ApJ, 666, 1024) to identify the SN type, phase, and redshift from the spectra.

"
ATEL #12244,Radio,"
We report on a recent NIR brightening of the high redshift (z=1.486) QSO
BZQJ2157+3127 associated with the radio source B22155+31 and the Gamma
ray source 3FGLJ2157.5+3126. On November 27th,2018 (MJD 2458449.7302) we
obtained NIR photometry for this object and found it with an increased
flux, corresponding to H = 16.562 +/- 0.04. Our previous photometry for
this object on JD2458026 yielded fainter fluxes H = 18.253 +/- 0.06, that
about a factor 5 smaller. The object is brightest since the time (MJD 245654t)
when we started monitoring it at NIR wavelengths. Our observations were
carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated
by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico),
equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera. We strongly encourage
further multiwavelength coverage.

ATEL #12245,Optical,"
We report Liverpool Telescope (LT; <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5489..679S"">Steele
et al. 2004</a>) spectroscopic observations of the M31 nova candidate AT2018jas.

A series of three 800s spectra were obtained with the SPRAT instrument
(<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9147E..8HP"">Piascik et
al. 2014</a>) on the LT at 2018 Nov 27.91 UT.  

The combined spectrum shows a blue continuum, which is punctuated by a
series of P Cygni line profiles that are themselves dominated by the absorption
component. Hydrogen Balmer series (H&alpha; - H&delta;), Fe II, and O I
P Cygni profiles are all clearly observed. There may be some evidence for
Si II (6347/6371) and He I P Cygni profiles also being present. The terminal
velocity of the H&alpha; P Cygni profile is around 4000 km/s.  

This spectrum indicates that AT2018jas is a classical nova eruption in
M31 that has been caught in the early Fe II-curtain phase (immediately
post-fireball).  

Liverpool Telescope observations of this eruption will continue and we
encourage additional follow-up observations. 

"
ATEL #12243,Radio,"
We report on the NIR brightening of the high redshift QSO 4C+01.02 (z=2.099),
cross identified with the Gamma ray source 2FGLJ0108.6+0135. 0n November
26th,2018 MJD(24578448.7551), we found the source with NIR fluxes J = 15.911
+/- 0.03, H = 14.905 +/- 0.05 and Ks = 14.130 +/- 0.04, while on MJD 2458025.94
the flux in the H band corresponded to H = 16.629 +/- 0.02. Hence, the
source has increased its flux by a factor of 5 in this lapse. The source
is brightest since the time we started monitoring it (MJD 2455471), when
the flux in the H band was H = 15.552 +/- 0.02. Our observations are carried
out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated
by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico),
equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera. We encourage further
multiwavelength coverage.

ATEL #12241,X-ray,"
Previously, we announced the detection (ATel #12207) of supersoft X-ray
source (SSS) emission from the 2018 eruption (ATel #12177) of the rapidly
recurring nova M31N 2008-12a (Darnley et al. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...563L...9D"">2014</a>,

<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...857...68H"">2018</a>).
Additional optical/UV photometry and optical spectroscopy of the 2018 eruption
was published in ATels #12179, #12181, #12182, #12189, #12190, #12195,
#12200, #12203, #12204, #12205. 

Here we report the disappearance of the SSS emission back towards quiescence
on November 25th. The entire 2018 eruption was monitored by the <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ApJ...611.1005G"">Neil
Gehrels Swift observatory</a> and a comprehensive multi-wavelength analysis
is in preparation following these preliminary findings: After the last
detection in a 6.1-ks Swift/XRT pointing on 2018-11-24.45 UT, with a faint
count rate of (0.3&plusmn;0.1) &times; 10<SUP>-2</SUP> ct/s, no source
was found in the subsequent 4.7-ks observation on 2018-11-25.12 UT (3&sigma;
upper limit of 0.3 &times; 10<SUP>-2</SUP> ct/s). Consequently, we estimate
an SSS turn-off time of around 18 days after the discovery date on 2018-11-06.80
UT (ATel #12177). 

This SSS turn-off time is overall consistent with the equivalent time scales
observed for the eruptions in 2013 (day 19&plusmn;1; <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...563L...8H"">Henze
et al. 2014</a>), 2014 (day 18.4&plusmn;0.5; ATel #6604 and <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...580A..46H"">Henze
et al. 2015a</a>), 2015 (day 18.6&plusmn;0.7; ATel #8062 and <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...833..149D"">Darnley
et al. 2016</a>), and 2017 (prior to day 18; ATel #11214 and Henze et al.
in preparation). We note that all these time scales are significantly longer
than for the peculiar 2016 eruption where the SSS phase had ended before
day 16 (ATel #9907 and Henze et al. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...857...68H"">2018</a>).

We wish to thank the Swift Team for the scheduling of the observations
and for the successful 2018 monitoring campaign, in particular B. Cenko,
the duty scientists, and the science planners.

ATEL #12242,Optical,"
We obtained a optical spectrum (range 340-840 nm) of SN 2018jag, discovered
by Tsinghua-NAOC Transient Survey, on UT November 26.6 2018 with the Lijiang
2.4-m telescope at Gaomeigu Station of Yunnan 
Astronomical Observatories (YNAO). The spectrum is consistent with that
of a subluminous type Ia supernova at a few days before the maximum light.
Cross correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the GELATO
(Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488,383) shows that it matched SN 1986G
at about t=-3 days before the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift
of 0.04 for its host galaxy MCG +02-03-030 (Hopp et al. 1995,A&AS, 109,
537), an expansion velocity of about 12700 km/s can be derived from the
absorption minimum of Si II 635.5 nm line.

the DLT40 survey in the nearby galaxy M77. The observation was performed
with the Asiago 1.22 m Galileo Galilei Telescope equipped with the B&C

Classification was done with GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488,
383) and SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).

(1) The spectrum shows a blue featureless continuum, with superposed emission
lines of the host galaxy, including 
Halpha, Hbeta, [O III], [S II]. Although no classical SN feature is evident
yet, this spectrum is consistent with 
that of a young core-collapse SN, most likely a type II event soon after
the explosion. This agrees with the TNS  
Classification Report No 3087. The redshift of M77  is from Huchra et al.

We obtained optical spectra (range 360-870 nm) of SN 2018ivc(=DLT18aq)
in M77, discovered by DLT40, on UT October 24.5 and 24.7 2018 with the
Xinglong 2.16-m telescope (+BFOSC) of National Astronomical Observatories
of China (NAOC) and Lijiang 2.4-m telescope at Gaomeigu Station of Yunnan
Astronomical Observatories (YNAO), respectively. The spectra are consistent
with that of a young type II supernova that suffered significant host-galaxy
reddening, with the equivalent width of the Na I absorption being measured
as about 2.5 Angstrom. A prominent absorption feature detected at around
627.0 nm can be due to the Ha line. The narrow Ha emission supposed on
the continuum seems to show a double peak structure, with an FWHM velocity
of 1200 km/s. Adopting a redshift of 0.0038 for the host galaxy (Huchra
et al. 1999, ApJS,121, 287), an expansion velocity of 13500 km/s can be
inferred for this SN. Followup observations are encouraged.

The bright blue transient Gaia17cuh/AT2017hwz on faint red Gaia source
near Galactic plane was triggered on 2017-11-02 when it brightened by more
than 3 mags and reached a G magnitude of 15.48. We observed this object
on 2017-11-18 with the 2-m RCC telescope at the Terskol Observatory and
found it to be faded (<a href='http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=11006'>ATel
#11006</a>). Further observations of this source by Gaia revealed in May
2018 a repeated increase in its brightness that allowed us to calculate
a next date this candidate CV to be appeared brighter. To prove this assumption,
early November 2018 we restarted to observe Gaia17cuh using the 60-cm telescope
at the Terskol Observatory (the North Caucasus) and the 70-cm telescope
at the Lisnyky Observatory (near Kyiv).  

The data acquired, especially R-band observations, indicated that the object's
brightness was continuously increasing from 2018-11-11. Amplitude of the
outburst is more than 3 mags. On  2018-11-22 we detected small variations
in R-band with amplitude of about 0.1 mag (<a href='http://aosimon.org.ua/sites/all/files/Gaia17cuh_2018-11-22.jpg'>

We report on the analysis of a 75ksec NuSTAR observation of Swift J005139.2-721704
in the SMC. The source was discovered serendipitously with Swift (ATel
#12209), and follow-up NICER observations identified it with pulsar SXP
4.78 (XTE J0052-723) in the SMC (ATel #12222). Optical observations showed
that it is associated with an early-type star ([M2002]20671= [2dFS]0811),
which shows H&alpha; emission (ATel #12224).   

The NuSTAR observations were  obtained between Nov. 15, 2018 and Nov 17,
2018.  The spectrum is well fitted with a power-law model with a photon
index of 1.1&plusmn;0.1 and a high-energy cutoff at 6.2 keV. We also detect
an Fe-K&alpha; line at 6.3&plusmn;0.2 keV.  The spectrum shows tentative
evidence for a cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) at 10.2&plusmn;0.3keV,
which would indicate a magnetic field of ~9&times;10<SUP>11</SUP>G. The
derived absorbed luminosity is L<SUB>X</SUB>~10<SUP>38</SUP>erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>
(4-25 keV; 60 kpc). 

The analysis of the NuSTAR light-curve yields a period of 4.7816072(73)s.
The energy resolved pulse profile shows higher pulsed fraction at higher
energies, and marginal evidence for spectral variations as a function of
phase.

ATEL #12236,X-ray,"
S-CUBED, the Swift Magellanic Cloud survey, performs a shallow (60s exposure)
142 tile exposure of the optical extent of the SMC, to search for transient
and regular outbursts from the large population of Be/X-ray binaries in
the SMC (Kennea et al., 2018, ApJ, 868, 47). 

Long term monitoring of the source SXP 304 by S-CUBED has detected two
outburst from this source. During the first outburst, the source was detected
by S-CUBED between MJD 57736.97 - 57764.57 (over 27.6 days starting Dec
14th, 2016), peaking at a flux of (1.0 +/- 0.4) x 10^-11 erg/s/cm^2 (0.5
- 10 keV). The second outburst is currently ongoing and was first detected
on MJD 58407.54 (Oct 16th, 2018) peaking at (1.5 +/- 0.5) x 10^-11 erg/s/cm^2
(0.5 - 10 keV) during the most recent observation on MJD 58442.34 (Nov
20th, 2018). Outside of these two outbursts, no X-rays have been detected
from SXP 304. 

The reported optically derived orbital period of SXP 304 is P = 520 +/-
12 days (Schmidtke and Cowley, 2006, AJ,132, 919), although the detection
of that period was weak. Subsequently Bird et al (2012, MNRAS 423, 366)
failed to find any convincing evidence for a binary period in the OGLE
III & IV data sets.  

If the two outbursts seen by S-CUBED are due to Type-1 outbursts (i.e.
the periastron passage of the Neutron Star), then this would be incompatible
with the purported 520 day period. The two outbursts are separated by ~662
days, and we suggest this as a candidate orbital period of SXP 304.

ATEL #12237,Optical,"
In ATel #12224 we reported the H&alpha; emission, derived from a wide-field
photometric survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (Maravelias et al. 2017,
IAUS 329, 373; Maravelias et al. 2019, in prep.), of the proposed optical
counterpart source [M2002] 20671 to the X-ray transient XTE J0052-723 pulsar
(SXP 4.78; Swift J005139.2-721704; ATel #12209). In addition to this clear
detection, the work of Bonanos et al. (2010, AJ, 140, 416) showed that
the IR colors of this source ([2dFS]0811; J=15.54 mag, J-[3.6]=0.56 mag)
are indicative of a ""photometric"" Be star, defined as sources with an intrinsic
color of J<SUB>IRSF</SUB>-[3.6]>0.5 mag. 

However, to confirm the nature of the counterpart optical spectroscopy
is needed. We obtained optical spectra using the LDSS-3 spectrograph on
the 6.5m Clay/Magellan telescope (Las Campanas Observatory). The observations
were performed on Nov. 20, 2018, acquiring two exposures of 600s each with
a 1&Prime; slit using the VPH-All grism (resulting in a 2630 -- 10859 &#8491;
wavelength range, at a nominal dispersion of 1.9 &#8491;/pix). The spectrum
shows a clear single-peaked H&alpha; line in emission, with a corresponding
equivalent width of -10.65&plusmn;0.14 &#8491;. This is the first optical
spectroscopic confirmation of the presence of H&alpha; in emission. We
note that H&beta; appears in emission as well. 

The spectral classification was based on the blue part of the spectrum
and the classification scheme used in Maravelias et al. (2014, MNRAS, 438,
2005). The presence of the OII+CIII 4640-4650 blend and the strong HeI
4471 line point to an early-type star (spectral type up to B2), which is
consistent with the absence of the MgII 4481 line and the weak SiII 4552
triplet line. The HeII 4200 and 4686 lines, which are indicative of B0.5
and earlier-spectral types, are absent, thus pointing to later types. 

Combining these criteria we constrain the optical classification to a B1-2e
source (with an error of 0.5 subtype). This is consistent with the early-type
B star classification proposed in ATel #12229, as well as the previous
classification of B0-B3 by Evans et al. (2004, MNRAS, 351, 601; source
ID [2dFS]0811). 

Thus, we provide the first optical spectrum with H&alpha; emission of the
optical counterpart of XTE J0052-723, further confirming its Be/X-ray binary
nature.

The transient Gaia18ddp (also known as AT 2018hnq) was reported on Oct.
24, 2018 (UT) as a potential candidate of supernovae. We also identified
the candidate from the follow-up observation with the Lee Sang Gak Telescope
on Oct. 26, 2018 (UT). Our examination of the Hubble Legacy Archive data
shows that the transient might be a supernova explosion in the extended
stellar halo of the brightest cluster galaxy of the cluster Abell 3395.

We acquired spectra of the transient Gaia18ddp by using Gemini GMOS-S in
a longslit mode. The spectra acquired on Nov. 11, 2018 (UT) evidently show
the spectral features of Type Ia supernovae at the cluster redshift z=0.05.

Our most recent photometric observations made on Nov. 14, 2018 (UT) reveal
that the SN is still bright at V ~ 20.3, R ~ 19.9, and I ~ 19.4 Vega mag
in images taken by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network. 

We thank the Gemini Observatory and its staff for conducting the observation

Spectra were obtained on 2018 Nov. 19.1 UT at Pisa using a 280 cm C11 telescope
with the LHIRES III at resolutions of about 1300 (total exposure time of
3600 sec; 4700-7700A)  and 18000 (6430-6631A; total exposures times of
3600 sec at each resolution) and on 2018 Oct. 31.1 UT at Tata with a 30cm
LH2400 telescope resolution of about16000 (6502-6611A; exposure time of
5400 sec), thus bracketing the observation reported in ATel #12227.  The
S/N ratio was > 10 in the continuum with the Halpha peak at about 40+/-2
times the continuum.  The Halpha profile shows broad, extended wings at
10 to 15 percent of the peak intensity extending to +/-1000 km/s.  The
Oct 31 Halpha profile shows a superimposed absorption with a blue edge
at -300 km/s that had weakened by Nov. 19 but with the blue side of the
emission decidedly asymmetric compared to the red wing (reversal of the
profile shows the absorption extends to nearly zero vrad).    The low resolution
spectrum shows little evidence other than profile asymmetry for absorption
at Halpha and Hbeta, aside from a complex of Fe II emission lines there
is a pronounced presence of the neutral He lines.  He I 4922 and 5013 are
much stronger than Fe II 4923 and 5018; Fe II 5169 is present but weak.
He I 5013, 5876, and 6678 show P Cyg profiles, even at low resolution,
with a similar blue absorption velocity to that of Halpha but with a higher
absorption to emission ratio (of order unity, for 5876 and 6678 allowing
for the resolution of about 5A, the absorption component is weaker on 5013).
Na I is in absorption, providing a check on the reality of the absorption
feature at low resolution.  Si II 6347, 6371 may be present but the low
resolution spectrum is not sufficiently high quality to be sure.   [O I]
6300 is not detected nor are there other obvious forbidden lines, Observations

ATEL #12229,Optical,"
A new X-ray transient, designated Swift J005139.2-721704, was reported
in Atel #12209 by Coe et al. Subsequently this region was observed by NICER
and a pulse period of 4.78 s reported (ATel #12222). Those authors (Strohmayer
et al) proposed that this object was associated with a previously known
RXTE pulsar (XTE 0052-723 = SXP 4.78) discovered by Corbet et al in 2001
(IAUC 7562). That source had never been successfully associated with an
optical counterpart due to the lack of imaging from RXTE. However the Swift
position of the current transient unambiguously associates Swift J005139.2-721704
with the OB star [M2002] SMC 20671. 

Further analysis of the OGLE III and IV data on [M2002] SMC 20671 were
carried out. In light of the proposed identification of this transient
with a 4.78s pulsar it was decided to explore the period range below the
2 days that was previously reported. The result was a strong detection
of a period at 1.805d, with a second somewhat weaker peak at the beat frequency
between that period and the 1 day typical sampling. Folding the data at
that period reveals a sinusoidal-like average lightcurve. If this is the
true binary period, then it is so short there is no time for the circumstellar
disk to generate the classic FRED-like modulation seen in much longer binary
period systems. 

The observed average colour and magnitude of [M2002] SMC 20671 determined
from OGLE are V-I = 0.13 and I = 15.5. This suggests that the object is
not a main sequence star in the SMC unless exceptional reddening (for objects
in the SMC) is introduced. Without such exceptional reddening the colours
are that of a late B-type, early A-type star. 

A blue spectrum was obtained from SALT on 16 November 2018 to investigate
the spectral classification of [M2002] SMC 20671. The spectral lines are
somewhat narrower than one might expect from a dwarf (luminosity class
V) star, but unlikely to be narrow enough to justify a supergiant classification.
The V=15.6 makes it also unlikely to be a SG. Certainly the spectrum is
not consistent with an early A-type - the lines of neutral helium are still
strong enough in this object to constrain it to being a B star. Overall
the SALT spectrum combined with the OGLE colours suggest most probably
that of a considerably reddened early type B star in the SMC. 

Assuming that this binary period of 1.8 d and the 4.78 s pulsations period
are coming from the same system, then it can be located on the Corbet diagram.
It sits in the region populated by the two Magellanic Cloud, Roche lobe
overflow (RLOF) systems, LMC X-4 and SMC X-1. But we note that unlike the
system that is the subject of this report, both of those systems have supergiant
mass donor stars. It seems unlikely that [M2002] SMC 20671 is a SG, hence
we have the first Be/X-ray binary possibly identified as a RLOF system.

New Swift observations taken on 18 November 2018 show that the system
has doubled in brightness in just 3 days and hence further observations
at all wavelengths are encouraged to try and understand this apparently
unusual system.

The symbiotic binary V694 Mon shows regular outbursts with the period of
1930 days (Doroshenko et al., IBVS No.3824, 1993) above the secular trend
of brightening from B = 14.1 mag in 1898 to B = 9.25 mag in 2016. The star
reached the breaking-record brightness in the last 2016 outburst (ATel#8653)
predicted with the known period. Broad and deep blue-shifted absorption
components of Balmer emission lines in the spectra formed by high-velocity
jets, and strong flickering of brightness in the scales of minutes and
hours with the amplitude up to 0.8 mag in the V band and 1.0 mag in the
U band are typical for this star. On 2018 Nov 4.12 UT we observed brightening
of the star up to the UBVRc magnitudes of (9.15, 9.57, 9.25, 8.50), consequently.
Observations were performed with the SAO 1-m Zeiss telescope and CCD photometer.
Additional analysis of the photometry taken with the 50-cm Maksutov telescope
of the Moscow University Crimean Station along with SAO data found the
star in this state in five nights between 2018 Oct 11 and Nov 5. Its V
brightness varied less than 0.07 mag, what suggests the disappearance of
flickering. A previous observation taken on 2018 May 2 at the end of the
past observational season gave UBVRc = (10.31, 10.52, 10.22, 9.41), and
flickering was then observed. The recent brightening happened at the phase
of 0.52 of 1930-day period, and it was not predicted. 

The spectral observations were performed with the SAO 1-m telescope and
UAGS spectrograph. In the spectra of V694 Mon taken around 2018 Nov 16.04
UT in the range between 3870 and 5280 &Aring; with the spectral resolution
of 2.2 &Aring;, we found the radical changes in comparison with the spectra
of the previous season. No high-velocity absorption components are seen.
H&beta; line has wide emission shoulders spreading to the velocities up
to 1000 km/s in both sides from the line center. There is a weak absorption
component at the velocity of -260 km/s relative to the peak of the emission.
Higher-number Balmer lines do not have emission shoulders but have the
absorption components at the velocity of -260 km/s. The depths of them
increase with the number. Wide and shallow He I absorptions changed to
narrower ones located on the velocity of -260 km/s. Peaks of the Fe II
emission lines are shifted by -50 km/s relative to the peaks of Balmer
lines. The same features are presented in the UAGS spectrum taken on 2018
Oct 17.10 UT in the range of 3800 - 7880 &Aring; with the lower resolution
of 6.2 &Aring;/pxl. While the last spectra taken at the past season from
January 9 to March 9, 2018 looked typical for this star with the high-velocity
absorption components. 

We explain this active state of the V694 Mon system as an episode of the
formation of a common envelope due to the transit of the system to a dynamical
mode of accretion with an increased rate. The accretion matter filling
the Roche lobe of the compact companion blocked the jets and overlapped
the direct visibility of the companion, so flickering was deleted. The
shell of the companion generates a stellar wind with the velocity of 260
km/s. We observed similar episodes in the relativistic jet binary SS 433
with blocking jets and even the disappearance of eclipses. In SS 433, these
episodes finish with an ejection of the envelope.

ATEL #12225,X-ray,"
Aquila X-1 is one of the neutron star LMXB transients with frequent outbursts
in the past few decades. It has been inactive in the X-ray band for about
250 days since its latest outburst reported in 2018 Feb (e.g. Atel#11382).

The hard X-ray monitoring observations performed with Swift/BAT indicated
that the X-ray intensity of Aquila X-1 in the 15-50 keV band has increased
from 13+/-11 mCrab to 38+/-9 mCrab in the last 10 days, which suggests
that Aquila X-1 may be in a new X-ray outburst again. However, the sun
angle of Aquila X-1 is lower than 60 degrees. Therefore it was uncertain
whether the enhance X-ray flux came from the source or not. Therefore,
we proposed a Swift ToO pointed observation towards Aquila X-1 to confirm
if it is indeed in a new X-ray outburst.  

The Swift/XRT observation was performed with the WT mode for about 500
seconds, starting at 17:19:04 of 2018-11-17 (UTC). We did a quick analysis
of the XRT data only. The net XRT X-ray count rate was 30.4+/-0.3 cps,
corresponding to about 50 mCrab in the XRT band. We fitted the XRT energy
spectrum in the 0.6-10 keV band with an absorbed power-law model, which
gave a hydrogen column density of 3.0+/-0.2 x10^21 cm^-2 and a power-law
index of 1.81+/-0.04. The X-ray flux in the 0.6-10 keV energy band is estimated
as 1.65+/-0.03 x10^-9 ergs/s/cm^2, corresponding to an X-ray luminosity
of 3.0x10^36 ergs/s at a source distance of 3.9 kpc. Therefore, we conclude
that Aquila X-1 is in a new X-ray outburst.  

We would like to thank the PI of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory for
approving our request and scheduling the ToO observation, and the Guest
Observer Facility for providing BAT monitoring data to the public.

(1) The spectrum of SN 2018ids, obtained on 2018-11-17.04 UT, is that of
a Type Ia SN at around the maximum light. The expansion velocity, inferred
from the  
wavelength of the Si II 635.5 nm line minimum, is 10700 km/s. The host
galaxy redshift is obtained by matching the SN features with Type Ia SN
templates. <br/> 
(2) The noisy spectrum of SN 2018ihx, obtained on 2018-11-17.07 UT, is
that of a Type Ia SN a few days after the B-band light curve peak. The
expansion 
velocity of the ejecta, as inferred from the minimum of the  Si II 635.5
nm line, is about 10700 km/s. The host galaxy redshift is obtained from
the position  
of the SN spectral features.

ATEL #12224,Optical,"
ATel #12209 reported the detection of a new X-ray transient in the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC), Swift J005139.2-721704, exhibiting outbursting
activity. The system has been classified as a new SMC high-mass X-ray binary
based on its identification with the B-type star [M2002]20671. NICER followed
up this source immediately (ATel #12219), reporting an absorption-corrected
luminosity of L<SUB>X</SUB> ~7&times;10<SUP>37</SUP>erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>
(0.5-8 keV; 60 kpc). Temporal analysis of NICER and Fermi/GBM observations
(ATel #12222) identified Swift J005139.2-721704 with the known X-ray pulsar
XTE J0052-723 (SXP 4.78). Evans et al. (2004, MNRAS, 353, 601) obtained
a refined B0-3(III) spectral type for [M2002]20671 (= [2dFS]0811) based
on optical spectroscopy, but they do not report H&alpha; emission. 

Here, we report the identification of the SMC star [M2002]20671, and thus
XTE J0052-723, with an H&alpha; emitting source, which confirms XTE J0052-723
as a Be/X-ray binary (Be-XRB) pulsar in the SMC. This source is identified
in H&alpha; and R-band observations covering the SMC almost completely
(Maravelias et al. 2017, IAUS 329, 373) using the Wide Field Imager on
the 2.2m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla (16/17 November 2011) and the MOSAIC-II
camera on the 4m Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo (15/16 December 2011).

The H&alpha; emitting source is found at RA=00:51:38.78 and DEC=-72:17:04.7
(better than 0.2&Prime; relative astrometry with respect to the 2MASS catalog).
It is located 2.2&Prime; away from the Swift position (ATel #12209), with
H&alpha; and R-band magnitudes equal to 15.476&plusmn;0.006 and 15.613&plusmn;0.008,
respectively. The resulting H&alpha;-R color is -0.137&plusmn;0.010 mag
with an SNR~13 above the continuum and an H&alpha; excess significance
of ~6&sigma; above the H&alpha;-R baseline value. The only nearby source
with significant H&alpha;-R excess is much fainter (H&alpha; and R ~22
mag), has a lower SNR (~4) and is located at a larger distance from the
X-ray source (~6&Prime;). 

Observations with the IMACS f/2 camera on the 6.5m Magellan Telescope (4
October 2004) give B=15.652&plusmn;0.009 mag and I=15.524&plusmn;0.017
mag (Strantzalis et al. 2018, IAUS 344, 453; Strantzalis et al. 2019, in
prep.), compatible with an OB star.  

All the identifications described above secure the nature of Swift J005139.2-721704
= XTE J0052-723 = SXP 4.78 as Be-XRB pulsar in the SMC.

ATEL #12220,Radio,"		Neutron Star, Transient, Variables

Further Swift observations of Swift J1858.6-0814 (Atel: #12151, #12158,
#12163, #12167, #12180, #12184, #12186, #12197) reveal evidence for significant
absorption intrinsic to the source.

In a ~1.9 ks XRT/windowed timing mode observation on 2018-11-14 (obsid:
00010955004), the source spectrum is measured to display clear signatures
of obscuration, with a significant soft excess and a nominally ultra hard
power-law component. Fitting the time-averaged spectrum with a model accounting
for partial covering absorption, we measure

pha(apec+pcfabs(po)): N_H = 0.2E22 cm^-2; kT = 0.23+/-0.03 keV; apec_norm
= (5.7+/-0.1)E-3; N_H_pcf = (1.7 +0.6 -0.5)E23 cm^-2; f_pcf = 0.88 +0.07
-0.17; gamma = 2.0+\-0.4 ; po_norm = (0.85 +2.02 -0.6)E-3; chi2/nu = 24.15/27,
where the errors are at the 1 sigma level.

The observed 0.5 - 10 keV flux is measured to be abs_fx = (1.4 +0.1 -0.5)E-11
erg/s/cm^2. The unabsorbed 0.5 - 10.0 keV flux in the power-law component
alone is unabs_fx_po = (4.1 +4.0 -1.7)E-11 erg/s/cm^2.

We caution that the flux uncertainties are quoted at the 90% confidence
level; however, due to the current low source flux relative to the background
in wt-mode, the quoted fluxes may be systematically uncertain at the 25-30%
level, i.e, abs_fx ~ 1.9E-11 erg/s/cm^2; unabs_fx_po ~ 5e-11 erg/s/cm^2
if the background is ignored.

The current source properties are consistent with those observed from V404
Cyg during the 
2015 outburst (e.g., Motta+ 2017, MNRAS, 468, 981) and previously from
V4641 Sgr (Morningstar+ 2014, ApJ, 786, 20), and suggest that significant
mass is being ejected from the inner accretion flow during the current
phase of the ongoing outburst.

Further multi-wavelength observations are encouraged.

(1) The spectrum of SN 2018hrn, obtained on 2018-11-16.03 UT, is that of
a Type Ia SN about 5-7 days after B-band maximum. The expansion velocity,

inferred from the wavelength of the Si II 635.5 nm line, is 11000 km/s.
Our classification agrees with the ZTF classification available in TNS

Classification Report No. 3035. <br/> 
(2) A low signal-to-noise spectrum of SN 2018iif, obtained on 2018-11-16.12
UT, shows it to be a Type II SN. The spectrum is blue, with Balmer  
lines showing multi-component profiles. A narrow, unresolved Halpha feature
sits on a broad component (with FWHM ~11000 km/s). A broad  
P Cygni profile is possibly detected for Hgamma, with the minimum blue-shifted
by about 6500 km/s. The redshift of the faint host galaxy is inferred 

from the position of the narrow Halpha. Adopting a standard cosmology with
H0 = 73 km/s/Mpc, we obtain a distance modulus of 39.88 mag. This  
gives a discovery absolute magnitude of about -20.5, and a current absolute
magnitude of -20.7.   <br/> 
(3) The spectrum of SN 2018iii, obtained on 2018-11-16.18 UT, matches that
of a Type Ia SN around the maximum light. The expansion velocity of the

SN ejecta, obtained from the minimum of the Si II 635.5 nm line, is 11500
km/s. The redshift of the host galaxy, SDSS J020805.21+231037.2, is obtained

from the position of the SN spectral features. <br/> 
(4) The spectrum of SN 2018idw, obtained on 2018-11-16.19 UT, is that of
a normal Type Ia a few days after maximum. The expansion velocity, inferred

from the minimum of the Si II 635.5 nm line, is about 9700 km/s. The redshift
of the host galaxy, ESO 427- G 001, is from Huchra et al. 2012, ApJS, 

199, 26, and matches fairly well the value obtained from the SN spectral
features. <br/> 

"
ATEL #12222,X-ray,"
We report on the temporal analysis of NICER and Fermi/GBM observations
of the new transient Swift J005139.2-721704 located in the SMC (ATel #12209,
#12219) that resulted in its identification with the known X-ray pulsar
XTE J0052-723 (SXP 4.78). 

We obtained 14.1 ksec of NICER data between 2018 November 14 at 22:11:16
UTC and 2018 November 16 at 16:20:39 UTC (ATel #12219). We analyzed the
cleaned NICER event list in the 0.35-9.0 keV range. We applied a barycenter
correction using the coordinates reported in ATel #12209. We computed the
power spectrum (Leahy normalized) and identified a fundamental peak and
its first harmonic. The fundamental peak is located at 0.20913 Hz (4.78
s). The detection significance is about 7.8 sigma. 
The pulse profile shape and amplitude resemble those derived from the RXTE
data (Laycock et al 2003).  

Following the detection of a periodic signal in the NICER data we performed
a dedicated search in the Fermi/GBM data. On November 11, Fermi/GBM detected
coherent pulsations from the direction of the SMC with a frequency of 209.1208&plusmn;0.0013
mHz. 

The spin period matches that of the known RXTE pulsar SXP 4.78 nominally
located at ~4&prime; distance from the transient system. 
We note that such a large discrepancy between RXTE/PCA-derived coordinates
and the actual position of X-ray systems is not atypical for SMC pulsars.
For example, SXP 2.16 was reported to have a positional uncertainty better
than 4&prime;  while the actual position of the system was ~16&prime; away
(ATel #8305; Vasilopoulos et al. 2017). 

The detection of a coherent signal strongly suggests that Swift J005139.2-721704
and XTE J0052-723 are the same source (SXP 4.78), and that the spin period
of the pulsar has shown little net change over the last 19 years. Furthermore,
based on the improved Swift/XRT position, the optical counterpart of SXP
4.78 is very likely the B-type star [M2002] SMC 20671 recently reported
in ATel #12209, and not the star [MA93]537 proposed by Laycock et al. (2003),
nor the star AzV 129 suggested by Coe et al. (2005).

ATEL #12219,X-ray,"
NICER observed the new transient Swift J005139.2-721704 located in the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and discovered on 2018 Nov. 9 (ATel #12209).
The source position identified using Swift XRT as RA=00:51:39.2 and DEC=-72:17:03.6
(with an uncertainty of 1.4&Prime;, ATel #12209). 

We obtained 8.6 ksec of NICER data between 2018 November 14 at 22:11:16
UTC and 2018 November 15 at 15:36:13 UTC. The average NICER count rate
is 22.4 c/s (5.4 mCrab) in the 0.5-8 keV range (after background subtraction
of ~0.5 c/s in that range). 

The spectrum can be described by an absorbed blackbody+powerlaw model in
0.5-8.0 keV range, with chi<SUP>2</SUP>=1.2 (399 d.o.f.), and with best
fit parameters N<SUB>H</SUB> = (0.56&plusmn;0.04) &times;10<SUP>22</SUP>cm<SUP>-2</SUP>,
kT = 0.120&plusmn;0.005 keV and a powerlaw photon index Gamma = 1.07&plusmn;0.03
(all uncertainties are at the 90% confidence level). The flux in that energy
range is 1.1&times;10<SUP>-10</SUP>erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, which
corresponds to a luminosity (corrected for absorption) of L<SUB>X</SUB>
~7&times;10<SUP>37</SUP>erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, assuming a distance of 60 kpc
to the SMC. 

A timing analysis on these initial NICER exposures finds no sign of short
period coherent pulsations. However, we find significant variability (~30%
fractional amplitude) on a timescale of ~600-650 seconds. The current NICER
snapshots are too short for a definitive conclusion on a periodicity on
such timescale, and additional observations are needed to decipher the
nature of this variability. We encourage follow-up observations with other
facilities. The short-term schedule of additional NICER observations is
as follows:

ATEL #12217,Cataclysmic Variable,"
Following the discovery of ATLAS18zfn and reported to TNS as AT2018iml
we noticed that this transient is coincident, within an error box of 0.3"",
with the position of SN 2009hz. Inserra et al 2009 (CBET 1907, http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/iau/cbet/001900/CBET001907.txt)
described the 2009  spectrum as a very blue, featureless continuum. A careful
re-analysis of the 2009 spectrum confirms the blue continuum and reveals
the presence of relatively weak 
absorption lines consistent with H-beta, H-gamma and H-delta at rest frame.
We thus re-classify the 2009 transient as a Galactic Cataclysmic variable,
which is now again in outburst.

(1) The spectrum of SN 2018ilu (2018-11-15.04 UT) is that of a very young
Type Ia SN about two weeks before maximum. The ejecta expansion velocity,
from  
the minimum of the Si II 635.5 nm line, is ~15000  km/s. The redshift of
the host galaxy is obtained from the best fit to the SN spectral features.
<br/> 
(2) The object was tentatively classified as a Type II SN by ATel #12044.
The new spectrum (2018-11-15.12 UT) shows it to be a luminous Type IIn

SN, similar to SN 2008fz (Drake et al. 2010, ApJ, 718, 127). The ATLAS
light curve shows SN 2018gea to be at least 3 months old. SN 2018gea was
observed  
as part of the GREAT survey (Chen et al. 2018, arXiv:1808.04382) on 2018-11-10
UT, with the following (AB) magnitudes: g=18.96, r=18.55, i=18.32, z=18.14,

J=18.07, H=18.03, K=18.27. This provides a black-body T_BB ~ 5500 K, with
evidence for a near-IR excess.  <br/> 
(3) The spectrum of SN 2018ihs, obtained on 2018-11-15.13 UT, is that of
a Type Ia SN a few days before the B-band maximum. The ejecta expansion
velocity, 
inferred from the Si II 635.5 nm minimum, is about 11000  km/s. The redshift
of 2MASX J02281399+2603363 is obtained from the main SN features. <br/>

(4) AT 2017cai was discovered by the Gaia survey ~20 months ago. A brightening
was observed on 2018-11-07.63 UT by ATLAS, at mag 17.438 (cyan-ATLAS).

The spectrum, obtained on 2018-11-15.32 UT, is very blue, with broad Balmer
lines in absorption (FWHM ~ 3200 km/s), centered at the observer rest frame.

This is a Galactic stellar transient, most likely a CV. <br/> 
(5) NGC 2992 is a well-known Sy2 galaxy, and the spectrum of the transient
in the core of the host (obtained on 2018-11-15.34 UT) agrees with that
classification.  
For this reason, AT 2018ikn should be considered as a flare event of a
known AGN. The redshift of NGC 2992 is from Keel 1996, ApJS, 106, 27. <br/>

ATEL #12213,Optical,"
The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) Bright Transient Survey
(BTS; ATel #11688) reports classifications of the following targets. Spectra
have been obtained with the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM)
(range 350-950nm, spectral resolution R~100) mounted on the Palomar 60-inch
(P60) telescope (Blagorodnova et. al. 2018, PASP, 130, 5003). Classifications
were done with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). Redshifts
are derived from the broad SN features (two decimal points), and from narrow
SN features or host galaxy lines (three decimal points). Limits prior to
detection and current magnitudes are available on the Transient Name Server
(https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il). ZTF has reported transient classifications
to TNS since those reported in ATel #12065 and would like to draw particular
attention to the following SNe:

ATEL #12214,Radio,"
We report on the NIR brightening of the low redshift QSO PKS2233-148 (z=0.325).
0n October 29th,2018 MJD(2458420.68199), we found the source with NIR flux
H = 13.209 +/- 0.06, while on MJD 2458069 the flux in the H band corresponded
to H = 14.866 +/- 0.03. Hence, the source has increased its flux by a factor
of 4.6 in this lapse. Our observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope
of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated by the National Institute for
Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument
CANICA a NIR camera. We encourage further multiwavelength coverage. 

"
ATEL #12207,Ultra-Violet,"
In ATel #12177 we announced the discovery of the 2018 eruption of the recurrent
nova M31N 2008-12a on 2018-11-06.80 UT. We reported the follow-up UV detection
with Swift/UVOT in ATel #12182. M31N 2008-12a has now been detected in
eruption 11 times in 11 consecutive years (cf. ATels #5607, #6527, #7964,
#9848, #11116). Comprehensive multi-wavelength studies of previous eruptions
were published by Darnley et al. (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...563L...9D"">2014</a>,
<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...580A..45D"">2015</a>,
<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...833..149D"">2016</a>) and
Henze et al. (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...563L...8H"">2014</a>,
<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...580A..46H"">2015a</a>,
<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...582L...8H"">2015b</a>,
<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...857...68H"">2018</a>).
For additional optical photometry and spectroscopy of the ongoing eruption
see ATels #12179, #12181, #12189, #12190, #12195, #12200, #12203, #12204,
#12205. 

Here we report the emergence of the supersoft X-ray source (SSS) phase
of M31N 2008-12a. A faint X-ray counterpart was detected in a 3.9-ks Swift
observation starting on 2018-11-13.02 UT. We measured the preliminary XRT
count rate to be (1.1&plusmn;0.2) &times; 10<SUP>-2</SUP> ct/s (corrected
for vignetting, dead time and PSF). No X-ray source was detected at a significant
level in the preceding 4.7-ks Swift observation on 2018-11-12.03 UT with
an 3&sigma; upper limit of 4.0 &times; 10<SUP>-3</SUP> ct/s. 

If we assume an eruption date of 2018-11-06.80 UT (MJD 58428.80), identical
to the discovery date (ATel #12177), then the SSS counterpart appeared
around day 6.2 after eruption. Taking into account the last non-detection,
this preliminary estimate is well consistent with the 5.9&plusmn;0.5 days
measured in 2014 (ATel #6558, Henze et al. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...580A..46H"">2015</a>),
the 5.7&plusmn;0.5 days seen in 2015 (ATel #7984, Darnley & Henze et al.
<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...833..149D"">2016</a>),
and the 5.8 days observed for the peculiar 2016 eruption (ATel #9872, Henze
et al. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...857...68H"">2018</a>).
Note the slightly earlier preliminary 4.7 days for the 2017 eruption (ATel
#11130). 

In addition, the nova is still detected as an ultraviolet (UV) source with
a magnitude of uvw2 = 19.5&plusmn;0.1 mag, well below the first UVOT measurement
of uvw2 = 17.3&plusmn;0.1 mag (ATel #12182). Our preliminary magnitudes
use the UVOT photometric system (Poole et al. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.383..627P"">2008</a>,
Breeveld et al. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AIPC.1358..373B"">2011</a>)
and have not been corrected for extinction. 

We wish to thank the Swift Team for the excellent scheduling of the observations,
in particular B. Cenko, the duty scientists, and the science planners.

"
ATEL #12208,Gamma Ray,"
Following the detection of a new flaring gamma-ray source, Fermi J1153-1124
(ATel #12206), we performed a dedicated analysis at the source location
(R.A., Decl. (J2000)= 178.44, -11.11 deg) using AGILE-GRID data. 

Integrating from 2018-11-09 00:00 UT until 2018-11-13 00:00 UT, a preliminary
maximum likelihood analysis yields a detection at the level of about 5
sigma and a flux F(E>100 MeV)=(2.0 +/- 0.7) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1, at Galactic
coordinates (l, b) =(280.8, 48.5) +/- 0.6 deg (95% stat. c.l.) +/- 0.1
deg (syst.) (R.A., Decl. (J2000) = 178.1, -11.8 deg). 

In a longer 7-day integration, starting from 2018-11-06 00:00 UT until
2018-11-13 00:00 UT, AGILE detected the source with a preliminary significance
of about 4 sigma and a flux F(E>100 MeV)=(1.2 +/- 0.4) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2
s^-1. 

This measurement was obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of the
sky in spinning mode. The source can be monitored with the public mobile
application ""AGILEScience"" developed by the AGILE Team, available for both
Android and iOS devices.

"
ATEL #12210,Neutrinos,"
The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports: 

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events arriving
from the position of Fermi J1153-1124 (http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=12206)
in a time window of 2 days (2018-11-10 00:00:00 UTC to 2018-11-13 00:00:00
UTC). 1 track event is found in spatial coincidence with Fermi J1153-1124
during this time period with a p-value of 0.019 (2.1 sigma) with respect
to an atmospheric background only hypothesis. Accordingly, this event would
represent a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux normalization upper limit
assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) at the 90% CL of 1.67 x 10^-4 TeV
cm^-2 for this observation period.  

The detected event, coincident with the source location within the track
uncertainties for these events (~0.5 degrees), arrived at:  

2018-11-11 07:41:30 UTC (MJD 58433.32048611)  

While this detected event does not represent a significant detection, its
arrival time is of potential interest to the astronomical community.  

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu.

"
ATEL #12209,Optical,"
Observations from the Niels Gehrels Swift telescope on 9 and 12 November
2018 revealed a new transient X-ray source in the SMC which we identify
as Swift J005139.2-721704. Previous observations of the same field on the
6 November barely detected the source. By the 12 November it had reached
0.5 counts/s in the XRT telescope. 

A follow-up 5ks Windows Timing measurements on 12 December  did not detect
any coherent pulsations. But we obtain a hard, photon index = 0.87 +/-
0.08 from the spectral fit - very similar to that obtained from the PC
mode date of 0.87 +/- 0.09. The Swift WT count rates indicate an X-ray
flux of 8E-11 erg/s/cm^2, corresponding to a luminosity of approximately
4E37 erg/s if the source is in the SMC. 

The best position of the new source is RA 00 51 39.2, Dec -72 17 03.6 with
an estimated uncertainty of 1.4 arc-seconds radius (90% confidence).  This
position is coincident with a V=15.6 B-type star [M2002] SMC 20671, and
hence this is probably a new SMC HMXB transient system. The current Swift
count rates indicate an X-ray luminosity of approximately 1E37 erg/s if
the source is in the SMC. 

OGLE III and IV data were examined for the proposed optical counterpart,
and it is noted that the star is brighter in the I-band than it has been
for the past ~6000 days. This suggest the recent growth, or increase in
size, of a circumstellar disk feeding the X-ray outburst. Timing analysis
of the OGLE data did not reveal any periodic behaviour in the 2 to 100
day range. 

X-ray and optical observations of the field are scheduled to follow this
outburst over the next few weeks.

located at the Kitt Peak National Observatory (SARA-KPNO), Arizona and
Roque de los Muchachos, La Palma, Spain (SARA-ORM), respectively. The exposure
times varied between 5 to 30 minutes. The derived magnitudes were calibrated

ATEL #12206,Gamma Ray,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed enhanced gamma-ray emission from a source
(Fermi J1153-1124) with coordinates R.A. = 178.44 deg, Decl. = -11.11 deg
(J2000) and 95% confidence error radius of 0.22 deg. Fermi J1153-1124 is
not in any published LAT catalog and was not detected by AGILE or EGRET.
The error circle contains a flat spectrum radio quasar, PKS J1153-1105,
located at z=0.269, which is also a VLBI calibrator. 

Preliminary analysis indicates that Fermi J1153-1124 went into a high flux
state on November 10, 2018, and further brightened on November 11, 2018
reaching a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (1.0+/-0.2) X 10^-6
photons cm^-2 s^-1 with a single power-law photon index of 2.34+/-0.12
(statistical uncertainty only). 

Because this is a new detection of this source, we strongly encourage further
multifrequency observations of this object. Since Fermi normally operates
in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this source will continue.
Fermi J1153-1124 is being added to the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently
a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi-LAT

We report on simultaneous multi-colour optical observations of the new
X-ray transient Swift J1858.6-0814, first discovered by Swift/BAT on 2018
October 31 22:53 UT (ATel #12151). This source has been found to display
significant variability, with flaring on timescales of seconds in both
X-rays and Optical (ATel #12158, #12163, #12164, #12186). The nature of
the source remains unclear, with both neutron star and black hole compact
object scenarios suggested (ATel #12158, #12180). Variable radio emission
supports the presence of a jet (ATel #12184). The Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia
Collaboration, 2018, A&A 616, A1) does not show any source with a measured
parallax within a search radius of 2 arcseconds around the coordinates
reported in ATel #12160. 

Our observations were carried out with the fast triple-beam camera ULTRACAM
on the ESO/NTT (Dhillon et al. 2007, MNRAS, 378, 825) on 2018 November
09, from 00:30-01:18 UT, for a total duration of ~48 minutes. u<span>'<span>,
g<span>'<span> and i<span>'<span> bands were observed simultaneously, and
we achieved a cycle time of 0.92 s in g<span>'<span> and and i<span>'<span>.
Up to 5 co-adds were used in u<span>'<span> to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio. The median signal-to-noise per frame was 15, 31 and 24 in u<span>'<span>,
g<span>'<span> and i<span>'</span>, respectively. Target counts were corrected
with a simultaneously observed bright comparison star.

The source exhibits stronger variability in the blue on timescales of minutes,
with rises and dips in flux by factors of ~2-5 (see link at the bottom).
The fractional variability amplitude (Vaughan et al. 2003, MNRAS 345, 1271)
was found to be ~0.42, ~0.34 and ~0.27 for u<span>'<span>, g<span>'<span>
and i<span>'</span>, respectively. Additionally, sporadic, short flares
are seen down to timescales of seconds. Similar single-filter fast optical
flares were also reported in ATel #12186 from data with a time resolution
of 7 s. We find these flares to be faster (<~5 s) and their colour to be
significantly red.

Although the duration of our observation is relatively short, these multicomponent
timing characteristics are reminiscent of those seen in the black hole
X-ray binary V404 Cyg, which showed slow bluer-when-brighter oscillations
as well as fast red sporadic flaring during its 2015 outburst (e.g. Kimura
et al. 2016, Nature 529, 54; Gandhi et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 554). Similarities
to V404 Cyg have already been suggested in X-rays (ATel #12158).

We highly encourage further observations to better sample and characterise
both the fast flares and the slower oscillations. In V404 Cyg, the rapid
red flaring was seen to strengthen near the peak of the outburst (Gandhi
et al. 2016). We also encourage rapid, simultaneous multiwavelength observations
to search for sub-second optical/infrared delays with respect to X-rays,
which would test the origin of the variations seen here. Ground-based optical/infrared
visibility of the source is worsening, so quick turnaround is important.

ATEL #12198,Optical,"
We report a spectroscopic observation of the optical transient ASASSN-18zj

(as known as AT 2018hyz) performed on Nov. 9, 2018 UT with the Kast 
spectrograph mounted on the 3-m Shane telescope at Lick Observatory. 

ASASSN-18zj (RA 10:06:50.875; Dec +01:41:33.96) was discovered by the 
All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014;

ATel #12194) on 2018-11-06.65 at g = 16.4 mag. According to ATel #12194,

the position of ASASSN-18zj is within ~0.1” of the center of its host

galaxy 2MASS J10065085+0141342 (redshift z = 0.045815, via NED), and its

luminosity was approximately M_g = -20.2 mag at the time of discovery.

The Lick/Kast spectrum reveals a blue continuum with a broad (~10,000 km/s)

H-alpha emission line and also weaker broad emission lines of (probably)

H-beta and He I 5876 Angstrom (rest wavelength). 

SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows good matches with 
young Type II supernovae. 

The spectroscopic features are also similar to those of optical tidal 
disruption event (TDE) candidates such as ASASSN-14ae (Holoien et al. 2014).

The SDSS archival spectrum of the host galaxy shows clear signatures of
an 
E+A/post-starburst galaxy with the presence of H-alpha absorption and other

strong Balmer absorption lines, including H-delta. Optical TDE candidates

are known to have a clear preference for E+A/post-starburst galaxies (Arcavi

et al. 2014; French et al. 2017). The transient's spectroscopic features,

high luminosity, and location (consistent with the host-galaxy center),

together with the E+A host, make ASASSN-18zj an excellent TDE candidate.

Multiwavelength follow-up observations are strongly encouraged.

Balmer lines with FWHM velocity of ~ 3500 km/s for H&alpha; and ~ 2000
km/s for H&beta;. Lines due to He I (5876, 6678, 7065), N III (4638) are

(1) The spectrum of SN 2018hwm, taken on Nov 8.33 UT, is that of a young
Type II SN. It shows a blue continuum and P Cygni H lines with a  
multi-component profile. The Balmer lines have a relatively broad P Cygni
component, with a minimum blue-shifted by 4400-4600 km/s, and a more  
prominent emission component, with FWHM ~ 3900-4100 km/s. Prominent, unresolved
narrow emission lines are superimposed to the broad components,  
that can be due either to SN circumstellar medium, or unrelated foreground
host galaxy gas. [O III] and [S II] lines are in fact also identified 

in the spectrum. The redshift of the host galaxy, IC 2327, is taken from
Falco et al. 1999, PASP, 111, 438.<br/> 
(2) The field of AT 2018hwp was imaged on Nov. 8.30 UT, and from a comparison
with available Skymapper images (ATel #5480), no new source is visible

in the acquisition image. The redshift of the host galaxy, ESO 354-G29,
is from Cappi et al. 1998, AJ, 115, 2250.<br/> 
(3) SN 2018hyw was originally discovered by the MASTER survey (see http://observ.pereplet.ru/;
Lipunov et al. 2004, AN, 325, 580), and labelled  
MASTER OT J082017.38+205232.2 (ATel #12038). The object was reobserved
on Nov, 11.50 by SNHunt and the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (with

survey name SNHunt396), that also posted their observation in TNS. The
object was classified by ATel #12133 as an evolved (+41 d) Type IIb event.

A spectrum of SN 2018hyw has been obtained by ePESSTO on Nov 8.37 UT, showing
broad P Cygni lines of Fe II, Na I, and Ca II. However, the strongest 

line is Halpha, which is much more prominent than usually observed in type
IIb SNe at about two months after the explosion. The ejecta velocity is

unusually high for a late Type II SN. From the wavelengths of the Halpha
and Na ID mimima, we find about 9000 km/s and 7900 kms, respectively. 

While He I 5876 can be blended with Na ID and He I 6678 with Halpha, there
is no evidence for the presence of the relatively unblended He I 7065.

The redshift of the host galaxy, UGC 4344, is from Schneider et al. 1990,
ApJS, 72, 245.

ATEL #12180,Optical,"
We report on optical observations of the newly discovered transient source
Swift J1858.6-0814 (first detected by the BAT instrument of the Swift satellite
on October 25th, 2018; ATel#12151). 

The source was observed in the r'-band using the the 2-metre Faulkes Telescope
North on November 6th, 2018.  
We obtained a series of 50 30-seconds integration images. The target is
well detected in all images at a position consistent with the Pan-STARRS
position of a previous known object (ID 98112846453925483), as also reported
in Vasilopoulos et al. 2018 (ATel#12164).

The source is found to be highly variable in our ~40 mins observation,
with a fractional rms of 21 +/- 1 % on a ~45 seconds time resolution; in
particular, we detect a maximum and minimum r'-band magnitude (which corresponds
to a minimum and maximum flux) of 17.58 +/- 0.03 and 16.71 +/- 0.02, with
a mean magnitude of 17.071 +/- 0.020 (from the fit of the light curve with
a constant).  
This indicates that the target has slightly brightened in the optical with
respect to previous observations (ATel#12164).

Finally, we considered the nH estimate given in ATel #12158, which is reported
to vary in the range 1.5E21 - 3E21 cm^-2 (from NICER observations). Using
the relation of Foight et al. 2016 (ApJ, 826, 66), from the nH we obtained
an estimate of the absorption coefficient Av (~ 0.78 +/- 0.26) and of the
E(B-V) (0.168-0.335). From Green et al. 2018 (MNRAS, 478, 651; see http://argonaut.skymaps.info/query?lon=113.14&lat=-57.61&coordsys=gal&mapname=bayestar2017),
for an E(B-V) ~ 0.168 - 0.335 we could obtain an estimate of the distance
of the target from the reddening-distance relation, which is found to be
in the range ~ 0.6 - 6 kpc (but we caution that reddening is not constrained
beyond 6 kpc). 

With this estimate of the distance, we constructed the optical-X-ray correlation
plot to identify the nature of the compact object of the system. For the
X-rays luminosity, we considered a 2-10 keV unabsorbed flux in the range
of 7.3(+/-2)e-11 - 1.47(+/-0.2)e-10 erg/s/cm2 (from observations obtained
with the Swift satellite on 2018 November 4th and 2nd, respectively). For
the optical luminosity, we considered the r'-band magnitudes reported in
ATel#12164, which were taken on November 3rd, contemporaneous with the
X-ray data. From the optical - X-ray correlation plot that we could build,
considering trial values of distance (1, 3, 6, 8, 24 kpc), we conclude
that the compact object of the system might be either a neutron star or
a black hole, depending on the actual value of the distance. In particular,
if the distance is low (~1 kpc), it it is more likely to be a neutron star;
instead, if the distance turns out to be higher (>3 kpc), the compact object
will more likely be a black hole. 

We encourage multiwavelength observations, especially radio, and coordinated
rapid timing data, e.g. simultaneous optical/infrared and X-ray observations.

The Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) observations are part of an on-going
monitoring campaign of ~ 40 low-mass X-ray binaries (Lewis et al. 2008)
with LCO and the Faulkes Telescopes. This work makes use of observations
from the Las Cumbres Observatory.

Gehrels Swift Observatory</a> ultra-violet/optical telescope (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005SSRv..120...95R"">UVOT</a>).

The first UVOT snapshot of the 2018 eruption was obtained on 2018-11-06.94
UT which is a record reaction time of only 3.4 hours after the discovery
on 2018-11-06.80 UT (ATel #12177). The nova was clearly detected in a 1-ks
observation with a uvw2 filter (Vega) magnitude of 17.3&plusmn;0.1 mag
(uvw2 central wavelength 193 nm). 

The magnitude estimate is preliminary, assumes the UVOT photometric system
(Poole et al. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.383..627P"">2008</a>,

and has not been corrected for extinction. Nothing is detected in the corresponding
Swift XRT exposure. We will continue to monitor the UV and X-ray evolution
of this exceptional nova. 

We wish to thank the Swift Team for the extremely rapid and efficient scheduling
of the ToO observations, in particular B. Cenko, the duty scientists, and
the science planners.

We obtained a spectrum of AT 2018hti / ATLAS18yff (Tonry et al. 2018, TNSCR
23913) on 2018 November 6.6 UT with the robotic FLOYDS instrument mounted
on the Las Cumbres Observatory 2-meter telescope on Haleakala, Hawai'i,
under the Global Supernova Project (PI: Howell).  

Using Superfit (Howell et al. 2005, ApJ, 634, 1190), we find a good fit
to the SLSN-I PTF09cnd at 16 days before peak. We measure the redshift
to be 0.062 from narrow host H and O III lines. Las Cumbres Observatory
images taken on 2018 November 4 show a MW-extinction-corrected V-band absolute
magnitude of the supernova of -20.7 (this value may include some host-galaxy
contamination).

ATEL #12184,Radio,"
Swift J1858.6-0814 was discovered by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT;
ATel #12151) on 2018-10-31, and was identified as a possible galactic object
due to its proximity to the galactic plane. We performed a followup observation
with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA) at the reported
BAT position on 2018-11-02.57, and two additional observations on 2018-11-03.71
and 2018-11-05.55 at the later refined Swift position (ATel #12158). The
observations lasted 2, 2 and 4 hours respectively and were performed at
a central frequency of 15.5 GHz with a 5 GHz bandwidth. We detect a source
consistent with the Swift position in all three of our images. 

The declination of Swift J1858.6-0814 is near the observing limit for
the AMI-LA, and the synthesised beam dimensionsions are large (~85x27""
for the 4 hour observation). We notice structured noise in our images,
again likely due to calibration issues at this low declination. We therefore
report only approximate flux measurements from our three observations of
~300, 400 and 600 uJy, respectively. 

We thank the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory staff for carrying out
these observations.

We report on the NIR brightening of the intermediate redshift QSO HB892345-167
(z=0.576). 0n October 27th,2018 MJD(24578418.7438), we found the source
with NIR fluxes  J = 14.029 +/- 0.02, H = 13.101 +/- 0.04 and Ks = 12.308
+/- 0.04, while on MJD 2458029.84 the flux in the H band corresponded to
H = 14.078 +/- 0.02. Hence, the source has increased its flux by a factor
of 2.5 in this lapse. The source is brightest since the time we started
monitoring it (MJD 2455486), when the flux in the H band was H = 14.997
+/- 0.06 Our observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the
Guillermo Haro Observatory operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics,

Following the X-ray and optical detection of a new transient source, Swift
J1858.6-0814 (ATel# 12151, ATel#12164, ATel#12180 ), we performed optical
follow-up observations of the source using the ULTRASPEC instrument mounted
on the 2.4m Thai National Telescope. The observations were performed on
6th of November starting at UT11:58:20.65 in SDSS r'-band. The exposure
time per frame was 7s, with a dead time of 15 ms between the frames, and
a total of 70 minutes of data were obtained 

The target is detected in all of our frames and the position is consistent
with the position previously reported in ATel#12180. The archival Pan-STARRS
r'-band magnitude of the system is 19.9705. We find that the source varies
between an r'-band magnitude of 18.1 and 16.3 on a timescale of a few tens
of seconds.  In particular, we note the detection of a very rapid flare
with a total duration < 21s in which the system brightens and fades by
0.9 magnitudes. Attached figure shows our light curve, calibrated using
3 stars in the field, the Pan-STARRS stacked g' image (top left), a 70s
stack of our ULTRASPEC data (top right), and the Swift XRT position (white).

encouraged.

(1) The redshift of the host galaxy, 2MASX J22240782+0409124, is provided
by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 13 as obtained Jan. 31, 2017.
The spectrum of  
ZTF18abzweee (obtained on Nov. 6.09 UT) is most likely that of a type 1
AGN, with relatively broad Balmer lines (FWHM ~ 4900 km/s), and much narrower
(unresolved)  
[O III] 4959,5007 A features, and the classification agrees with that provided
by the SDSS survey.  
(2) The transient in NGC 665 is not confirmed, as it was not visible in
our acquisition image. The redshift of NGC 665 is from Springob et al.
2005, ApJS, 160, 149. 
(3) The spectrum of SN 2018htf (obtained on Nov. 6.31 UT) shows a very
blue continuum (T_bb ~ 9300 K) with superposed weak and narrow P Cygni
lines of the Balmer series.  
The redshift of the host galaxy is inferred from the wavelengths of the
narrow emission lines of the transient. The transient is possibly associated
with NGC 1166, whose  
redshift is z=0.025661 (Huchra et al. 1999, ApJS, 121, 287; via NED), close
to that obtained from the transient's emission lines. In this case, the
projected distance  
from the host would be ~8 kpc. The expansion velocity of the gas, deduced
from the position of the minimum of Halpha, is about 1060 km/s. This is
likely a very young  
Type II SN, with narrow lines being produced in surrounding, slow-moving
photo-ionized circum-stellar medium. The discovery absolute magnitude is
about -17.3.

November 5.45 (MJD 2458427.5). The detection was confirmed with V and R
imaging on the Kuiper 61-inch telescope (+ Mont4k imager) on UT 2018 November
6.5.  Previous images of the galaxy taken by our group in 2015 and 2016
do not reveal an object at that location. 

The transient has an apparent magnitude of r = 20.85 mags.  Using a Virgo
+ GA only distance modulus of 36.08 mag and a foreground extinction of
A_r = 0.12 mag from NED gives an absolute magnitude of M_r = -15.3.  This
suggests the transient could be a lower luminosity supernova near peak,
or a normal supernova some time before or after peak.  Spectroscopic follow-up
is encouraged for the classification of this object.

The first of a long series of 600s spectra was obtained by the SPRAT instrument
on the Liverpool Telescope at 2018 Nov 06.96 UT. This spectrum displayed
a blue continuum with very broad and faint Balmer series emission lines.
This spectrum is consistent with early spectra of previous eruptions. 

We will continue to monitor the nova light curve and strongly encourage
additional follow-up observations. Our follow-up campaign with Swift has

ePESSTO, the extended Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transient Objects
(see Smartt et al. 2015, A&A, 579, 40; http://www.pessto.org),  
reports the re-classification of DLT18an/AT 2018htr, discovered by the
DLT40 survey. The observation was performed with the ESO New Technology

Telescope at La Silla on 2018 November 6.15 (UT), using EFOSC2 and Grism
11 (3350-7450A, 14A resolution).  

Survey Name | IAU Name   | RA (J2000)  | Dec (J2000)  | Disc. Date (UT)
| Source   | Disc Mag |    z    | Type   | Phase | Notes 
DLT18an     | AT 2018htr | 00:14:07.96 | -23:10:09.71 |  20181103.99  
|  DLT40   | 19.4 (r) | 0.00156 |  nova  | +1d   | (1)  

(1) AT 2018htr was originally classified as a likely LBV outburst (ATel
#12166). The new spectrum reveals a redder continuum, still prominent 

H and Ca II lines, and very pronounced P Cygni Fe II lines. The expansion
velocity of the ejecta, as deduced from the minimum of Hbeta, is about

1400 km/s. Halpha has a prominent emission component with FWHM ~ 1900 km/s,
and a much weaker absorption component. The spectral features and  
the overall evolution are best explained with an outburst of a Fe Nova.
<br/> 

A careful analysis of DLT40 images provides the following light curve:
<br/> 

Date         MJD         r <br/> 
20181031   58422.16   >20.49<br/>  
20181101   58423.04    20.25 +/- 0.29<br/>

20181103   58425.07    19.34 +/- 0.09<br/> 
20181104   58426.00    19.39 +/- 0.13<br/> 

Adopting a TRGB distance of 6.6 Mpc (Tully et al., 2013, AJ, 146, 86) for
the host galaxy NGC 45, the peak absolute magnitude of the transient  
is M_r = -9.9 mag, which is bright but consistent with a luminous Fe nova.
<br\> 
We also see a faint red source at the approximate position of  AT 2018htr
in archival HST F555W and F814W images taken in 2004. Regardless of whether
this source is coincident or not, we do not see a very luminous progenitor
as would be expected for an LBV, as proposed in ATel #12166.

ATEL #12173,Infra-Red,"
We call attention to the unusual host object of a blue transient, Gaia18dcu,
in the Kepler field.  

The object is noteworthy in having a very hot quiescent SED which we find
dominates not only the UV but also the visible bandpasses, a quiescent
Lbol of at least ~11x Lsun over several years, and a strong H-alpha excess
in at least one quiescent epoch.  

Gaia reports that it has shown a historical variability of ~0.5 magnitude
and a G magnitude of ~20.5.  It showed an increase of ~3.5 magnitudes in
the outburst detected by Gaia.  Variability of ~0.5 magnitude is also seen
in two catalog r band values. 

We performed SED fitting using catalog data.  We used data from the Pan-STARRS
Release 1, the Kepler INT Survey (Greiss et al. 2012, AJ, 144, 24), Gaia
catalog photometry, and the GALEX NUV Survey (Olmedo et al. 2015, ApJ,
813, 100).   It was detected by NEOWISE-R.  We obtained additional measurements
from archival GALEX FUV and Spitzer IRAC images.    

We fitted the visible-UV SED to a single-object blackbody.  The Av was
allowed to vary as a free parameter from 0.30 to 10, with the lower limit
set by the 3-D extinction map of Green et al. (2018; MNRAS, 478, 651).
The Teff was varied from 1000 K to 100,000 K in 100 K increments.  Only
a very poor fit could be obtained for the combined UV-visible-IR SED, but
a good fit using UV and optical data, so we excluded IR data from the fitting
except as upper limits.  Comparison with the blackbody SED suggests an
IR excess.  Also, there is evidence of variability by a factor of several
in across two epochs in the Spitzer and WISE IR photometry. 

The best fit was obtained for a blackbody of 50,000 +/- 2000 K with Av
= 1.81 +/- 024.  The fact that the Av value is much larger than expected
from interstellar extinction supports the presence of an IR excess from
dust.  

The SED and best-fit blackbody may be viewed at  

http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/seppo/gaia-figures/Gaia18dcu_SED.png

and 

http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/seppo/gaia-figures/Gaia18dcu_SED_fit.png

The nearest X-ray or gamma ray source cataloged is 12.8 arcmin +/- 15 arcsec
distant.  Nondetection by the RASS survey places a very approximate X-ray
upper limit of ~10x the GALEX FUV flux, consistent with a ~50,000 K blackbody.

Based on the blackbody SED, we estimate a bolometric luminosity of 11x
Lsun to 85x  Lsun, where the uncertainty is reflects the Gaia distance
uncertainty (1289 to 7355 pc). 

The Lbol is a few orders of magnitude less than expected of a 50,000 K
stellar source. This along with the H-alpha excess suggests that the optical-UV
emission is dominated by an accretion disk.   

Gaia18dcu is not in the 2MASS catalog, but from the catalog image we placed
an upper limit of  Ks ~18 +/- 0.5.  This is roughly two magnitudes fainter
than the absolute magnitude of a main sequence late M star at ~1200 pc.
Thus any cool object in the system is probably not earlier than spectral
type M unless it is well beyond the Gaia ~7300 pc one-sigma maximum distance.

We suggest that Gaia18dcu might be a previously unknown interacting binary.
Spectroscopy of this object is encouraged.

ATEL #12169,Optical,"
We report on recent NICER X-ray follow-up observations of the nuclear transient
AT2018zf (ASASSN-18el; ATel #11391), initially classified as a Type II
supernova (TNSCR #499) but which later displayed emission lines typical
of broad-line AGN (Trakhtenbrot et al., in prep). The transient is spatially
coincident with Seyfert galaxy 1ES 1927+654 (z=0.017), and may be evidence
of an extremely rapid accretion episode.  

Archival observations of 1ES 1927+654 in 2011 showed an already remarkable
source, which defies AGN unification models. It was optically classified
as a Type-2 AGN, but showed very little X-ray obscuration (Gallo et al.,
2013, MNRAS, 433, 421).  The archival X-ray spectrum was described with
a \Gamma~2.4 power-law, and soft excess below 1 keV. The average 0.3-10
keV flux was ~1e-11 erg/cm^2/s. The flux varied rapidly, with a fractional
excess variance of 25% on timescales ranging from 10 ks down to 500 seconds.
This spectrum and variability is typical of an unobscured, high Eddington-ratio
Type 1 AGN.  

NICER began observing 1ES 1927+654 on 2018-05-22 (2.5 months after the
ASAS-SN flare on 2018-03-03), and continues monitoring with 1-3 day cadence.
The 0.3-10 keV flux in May was similar to archival observations (~1e-11
erg/cm^2/s), but the spectral shape had changed dramatically. Compared
to archival spectra, the new spectra are extremely soft, described roughly
as a 0.1 keV blackbody with very little hard X-ray emission above 2 keV.
This is confirmed with an XMM-Newton DDT observation on 2018-06-05 (PI:
C. Ricci). The 2-10 keV flux had decreased by ~2 orders of magnitude or
more compared to the 2011 archival observations. We find little change
in intrinsic absorption (N_H~4.0e20 cm^-2). The source varies rapidly on
timescales from 10 ks to 500 seconds, with fractional excess variance of
35%.  

Then from May-July 2018, the average X-ray flux decreased by >2 orders
of magnitude, with inter-day flux variability from 1e-12 to 5e-11 erg/cm^2/s
in the 0.5--2 keV band (see NICER light curve in link below). Over this
time, there was little evolution in spectral shape. In August, the X-ray
flux began to increase again, and the source is now brighter in X-rays
than in May. The source continues to exhibit inter-day flux variability
by as much as an order of magnitude. The weekly mean continues to increase
through 2018-10-26, accompanied by a spectral hardening inferred by an
increase in the NICER soft color hardness ratio (1-2 keV / 0.4-1.0 keV).

ATEL #12167,X-ray,"
The recently discovered X-ray transient Swift J1858.6-0814 (ATel #12151,
#12158, #12160, #12163, #12164) has been observed by INTEGRAL during some
slewing science windows (SCWs) performed in revolution 2013 (SCWs 99 and
100), 2014 (SCWs 96 and 97), 2015 (SCWs 93 and 94), 2016 (SCWs 93 and 94),
and 2017 (SCWs 92 and 93). These SCWs cover the period  from 2018 October
22 at 15:04 to November 2 at 6:55 UT.  

We built the IBIS/ISGRI mosaic combining all the above mentioned SCWs and
found that the source is detected at a significance of 9 sigma in the 20-40
keV energy band and the corresponding flux is 28+/-3 mCrab. The source
is only marginally detected in the 40-80 keV energy band (5 sigma) with
an estimated flux of 25+/-5 mCrab.  

The IBIS/ISGRI spectrum (effective exposure time 3.5 ks) could be preliminary
described (reduced chi^2/d.o.f. = 1.3/8) with a power-law model. We measured
a photon index of 2.2+/-0.7 and a 20-100 keV flux of 3.6E-10 erg/cm^2/s.

No JEM-X data are available for the considered SCWs.  

No pointed observations with INTEGRAL have been already planned for Swift
J1858.6-0814, but it will be serendipitously observed during similar slewing
SCWs in the coming days.

We report spectral observations, made on 2018 Nov 4 UT, of AT 2018htr,
discovered by DLT40 in NGC 0045,  
with the Goodman spectrograph (wavelength range 3800 - 8950 A) on the SOAR
telescope.  The spectrum is blue with Balmer and He I P-Cygni features
and several strong absorption features including Ca H&K and several Fe
II lines.  The spectrum is generically similar to ""cool"" LBV outbursts
such as UGC 2773 OT-1 (Smith et al., 2010, AJ, 193, 1451; Foley et al.,
2011, ApJ, 732, 32).  The spectrum is also similar to the Type IIn SN 1994W
(Sollerman et al., 1998, ApJ, 493, 933).  Correcting for the small redshift
of NGC 0045 (cz = 467 km/s; Monnier Ragaigne et al., 2003, A&A, 408, 465),
we find that the minimum of the H-alpha absorption for AT 2018htr is blueshifted
by -1240 km/s.  The absorption feature extends to approximately -2100 km/s.

We also report photometric observations, also made on 2018 Nov 4 UT, of
AT2018htr with the Swope telescope (+ Direct imager).  At 20181104.02 UT,
we measure g = 19.4 +/- 0.1 mag, fainter than the observation made by DLT40
two days earlier (20181102.07 UT), where they report a clear magnitude
of 17.5 +/- 1.1 mag.  To test if AT 2018htr was fading quickly, we obtained
another epoch (at 20181104.10 UT), but it has not faded significantly between
the two epochs. 

Using a Tully-Fisher distance to NGC 0045 of 9.2 Mpc (Karachentsev et al.,
2013, AJ, 145, 101) or alternatively a TRGB distance of 6.6 Mpc (Tully
et al., 2013, AJ, 146, 86), we find that the transient is currently M_g
= -10.5 or -9.8 mag, respectively.  This is fainter than most LBV outbursts
and similar to the quiescent luminosity of some LBVs.  It is significantly
fainter than any SN IIn, and we therefore consider AT 2018htr likely an
LBV or other stellar outburst. 

We thank the SOAR observatory staff, particularly C. Corco, P. Ugarte,
and SOAR director J. Elias for rapid execution of this ToO observation
under NOAO program 2018B-0315.

ATEL #12163,X-ray,"
Following the discovery of the X-ray transient Swift J1858.6-0814 (Krimm
et al. ATel #12151, also Ludlum et al. #12158 and Kennea et al. #12160),
we investigated the source activity after October 9 (MJD 58400) using MAXI/GSC
data. We find that the 2-10 keV X-ray flux tends to increase since around
October 24 (MJD 58415), and decrease after October 30 (MJD 58421). The
1-day averaged 2-10 keV X-ray fluxes on October 24 and 29 (around the peak)
were 0.009 (+0.009, - 0.008) c/s/cm2 (~ 4 mCab) and 0.017 (+0.010,-0.009)
c/s/cm2 (8 mCrab), respectively. This soft X-ray fluxes lower than the
hard ones Swift/BAT obtained (ATel #12151) are consistent with a very hard
spectrum in the faint state when NICER (ATel #12158) and Swift/XRT (#12160)
observed.

MAXI/GSC also marginally detected two bright flares from the region consistent
with the source position at 09:32 UT on October 27 and 02:25 on October
30. The flares have different spectral properties though the difference
is not significant. 
The former flare has a soft spectrum, similar to flares NICER detected
(ATel #12158), and average count-rates are 0.099 (+0.035,-0.029) and 0.048
(+0.029,-0.022) c/s/cm2 at 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV, respectively. 
While the latter has a hard spectrum having count-rates of 0.018 (+0.021,-0.014)
and 0.105 (+0.041,-0.034) c/s/cm2 at 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV, respectively.

Swift J1858.6-0814: Localization and variability of the optical counterpart

G. Vasilopoulos (Yale), C. Bailyn (Yale), J. Milburn (Caltech) 

Following the detection of the new galactic transient source Swift J1858.6-0814
(Krimm et al. ATEL #12151) we performed photometric follow up observations
of its optical counterpart using the WASP instrument on the Hale 200"" Telescope
at Palomar Observatory.  

We analyzed a Swift/XRT ToO observation (obsid: 00010955001) to obtain
a rough localization of the source (see also Kennea et al. ATEL #12160).

Optical observations were performed around the X-ray position. 
We identified an object consistent with the X-ray position reported by
Kennea et al. ATEL #12160, that has brightened at least 2.5 magnitudes
above the Pan-STARRS  r' image (data release 1; Chambers+ 2016). 
The Pan-STARRS object ID is 98112846453925483 and its reported coordinates:	

RA(J2000)= 18:58:34.893   

DEC(J2000)=-08:14:14.938 

A series of 20 second R-band exposures over a period of 40 minutes between
58425.11-58425.14 MJD showed the object to vary within the range r'=16.9
to r'=18.4 (+/- 0.1 magnitudes). 
Variability of up to 1 magnitude was observed on a timescale of 2 minutes.

Conditions were non-photometric, and magnitudes were determined by differential
photometry with respect to Pan-STARRS objects 98112846446163754, 98112846438888093
and 98122846447171896.

ATEL #12157,Radio,"
We are continuing to regularly collect spectra and UBVRI photometry of
MAXI 1820+070 with the Asiago 1.22m, 1.82m and Schmidt 67/92 telescopes,
and ANS Collaboration telescope ID 2300, in coordination with optical timing
observations carried out by the AQUEYE+IQUEYE Collaboration (ATel #11723,
#11824, #11936). MAXI 1820+070 (= ASASSN-18ey) has been proposed to be
a black hole X-ray binary by Baglio et al. (ATel #11418), following the
discovery of the source by Kawamuro et al. (ATel #11399) on 2018 March
11, and is being intensively monitored worldwide over the whole range of
the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. ATel #12061, #11887, #11855, #11833,
#11831, #11578, #11490). 

After the hard to soft transition in the X-ray band reported by Homan et
al. (ATel #11820) on July 5, a reverse transition from the soft to hard
state was observed starting at around September 22 (Negoro et al., ATel
#12057). With a certain delay after this transition, also the optical emission
of MAXI 1820+070 started to change. Baglio et al. (ATel #12128) reported
a re-brightening at optical wavelengths taking place after October 5, delayed
by almost two weeks from the increase in the hard X-rays and the subsequent
radio detection (indicating the likely reactivation of the jet; Bright
et al., ATel #12061). 

Here we confirm the results of Baglio et al. and provide further information
on the evolution of the optical emission during October 2018. Averaging
over the short time-scale periodicities displayed by the object, the mean
brightness and colors of MAXI 1820+070 in our data are given in the table
reported below. Following the soft to hard transition of September 22,
the brightness decline became faster and the source reached a sharp minimum
centered on Oct 3.8 UT, while keeping the same blue colors it had before.
The recovery from this sharp minimum was accompanied by the colors becoming
significantly redder, with a new maximum being reached around Oct 12.0
UT. MAXI 1820+070 then entered a smooth decline phase characterized by
stable colors, redder than those in the pre-brightening phase. In our last
observing run for Oct 30.8 UT, effectively marking the conclusion of the
October re-brightening event, we measured a magnitude B=15.02 and colors
B-V=+031, V-R=+030. The main lasting effect of the October evolutions is
then a change in the optical colors from a median value of B-V=+0.16 and
V-R=+0.18 before re-brightening, to B-V=+0.30 and V-R=+0.30 during and
after it.

ATEL #12158,X-ray,"
We report on initial NICER observations of the new Galactic transient source
Swift J1858.6-0814 (ATel #12151). It is unclear if the source is a black
hole or a neutron star.  

NICER observed Swift J1858.6 on 2018-11-01, beginning at 15:52 UT, for
an exposure of ~9 ks. Initial attempts to localize the source within the
3 arcmin error circle (ATel #12151)--by employing pointing coordinates
offset by 1 and 2 arcminutes from the nominal position in hopes of ""peaking
up"" the signal--were hampered by large count-rate fluctuations from the
source; we nevertheless settled on a pointing direction 1 arcmin to the
south (RA, Dec = 284.673 deg, -8.26167 deg) to acquire most of the available
exposure. Uncertainty in the source position at this level can result in
5-10% errors in spectral analysis. The light curve showed prominent flaring
on time scales of seconds, with one of the flares exhibiting an increase
in count rate by a factor of a few hundred over a span of 15 seconds. A
figure of the 0.5-10 keV light curve from our observations (1 second time
resolution and with data gaps removed) can be found at the link provided
below. A preliminary timing analysis did not reveal any quasi-periodic
features or pulsations.  

Time-averaged energy spectra were extracted for three different intensity
intervals, selecting COR_SAX>4, and normalized to the Crab Nebula as per
Ludlam et al. 2018. The spectra could be described by the simple phenomenological
model of an absorbed thermal disk and power-law component. The spectrum
extracted from the highest intensity interval (>100 cts/s) had an exposure
time of ~290 seconds at an absorbed 0.5-10 keV flux of ~6.5E-10 ergs/cm2/s.
The column density was measured to be nH~3E21 cm^-2, the disk temperature
approximately 0.29 keV, and the photon index Gamma was ~1.2. The spectrum
extracted at intermediate intensity (20-100 cts/s) had an exposure time
of ~714 seconds and an absorbed flux of ~2.2E-10 ergs/cm2/s in the 0.5-10
keV band. We found a column density of nH~2E21 cm^-2, a disk temperature
of kT~ 0.17 keV, and a photon index Gamma~1. The lowest intensity interval
(<20 cts/s) had an exposure time of 5.6 ks, was incredibly hard (Gamma<1),
and had an absorbed flux of 2.6E-11 ergs/cm2/s when the absorption column
was fixed at 1.5E21 cm^-2. The source exhibits both Fe K and Fe L reflection
features.  

The large amplitude flaring in the light curve, hard spectrum, and prominent
reflection features resemble the behavior of the Galactic microquasars
V4641 Sgr and V404 Cyg (see, e.g., Figure 1 in Wijnands & van der Klis
2000 and Rodriguez et. al. 2015, respectively).  

Further NICER observations of this source are underway--see the observation
schedule link below. Additional multiwavelength follow-up is strongly encouraged.

NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space
Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities

Swift performed a target of opportunity observation of Swift J1858.6-0814
(Krimm et al. ATEL #12151) starting on Nov 2nd at 14:30UT. A 1ks exposure
in Photon Counting mode was taken. We find a previously uncatalogued point
source at the following position, RA/Dec = 284.64565, -8.23789, which is
equivalent to: 

RA(J200) = 18h 58m 34.96s,  

Dec(J2000) = -08d 14' 16.4'', 

with an estimated error of  2.2 arc-seconds radius (90% confidence). 

The PC mode data, corrected for pile-up, show a hard spectrum, with a photon
index of 0.22 +/-0.23, with absorption consistent with the Galactic value.
The PC mode light curve shows significant flaring over the short exposure,
as previously reported by NICER observations (Ludlam  et al., ATEL #12158).

The XRT position is consistent with stars in the UKIDSS-DR5 and Pan-STARRS
PS1 catalogs. The star, designated UGPS J185834.91-081414.8 in the UKIDSS-DR5
catalog, has a J-band magnitude of 18.5. 

In UVOT data, taken in three UV filters, a point source was detected at
a position consistent with the XRT position, RA/Dec = 284.64549, -8.23775,
equivalent to: 

RA(J2000) = 18h 58m 34.9s 

Dec(J2000) = -8d 14' 15.89'' 

This position lies 0.74 arc-seconds from the center of the XRT error region.
The UVOT measured magnitudes are uvw1 = 16.87 +/- 0.20 (stat) +/- 0.03
(sys), uvm2 = 16.32 +/- 0.16 (stat) +/- 0.03 (sys), uvw2 = 17.38 +/- 0.05
(stat) +/- 0.03 (sys) in the Vega system. 

The source continues to be detected in the BAT at approximately the same
level reported in Krimm et al. (ATEL #12151).

The source was first detected on 2018-10-31.53 (UT) at r = 19.4 mag (absolute
magnitude of M = -12.2), and has been rising at the rate of ~ 0.25 mag
/ day with g - r color ~ 0.5. Spectroscopic follow-up was obtained on 2018-11-02
UT with the GMOS on the Gemini-N telescope  and with DBSP on the 200-inch
Hale Telescope at Palomar observatory. The early spectra exhibit intermediate
width Balmer emission lines with FWHM of ~ 1000 km/s, consistent with a
Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) outburst or a young SN IIn. Further photometric
and spectroscopic follow-up is underway and encouraged.

ePESSTO, the extended Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transient Objects
(see Smartt et al. 2015, A&A, 579, 40; http://www.pessto.org ), reports

the following classification. The target was supplied by the Lick Observatory
Supernova Search (LOSS, Modak et al. TNS ATR No 23639).  
Information on the object was taken from the IAU TNS list (see https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/)
. <br/> 

The observations was performed on the ESO New Technology Telescope at La
Silla on 2018 November 2.11 (avg. UT), equipped with EFOSC2, plus Grism
13 
(3985-9315A, 18A resolution) and Grism 11 (3335-7450A, 14A resolution).

The classification was done with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666,
1024) and GELATO (Harutyunyan et al., 2008,  A&A, 488, 383).

(1) The spectrum of AT 2018hrg in NGC 404 (not UGC 404, as erroneously
reported by ATel #12155) shows a  blue continuum with superposed strong

P Cygni features of the Balmer series, and Fe II multiplets. P Cygni lines
of O I and Ca II are also observed. The ejecta velocity, obtained from

the position of the minimum of Halpha, is about  1250 km/s. The general
description of the spectrum agrees with that reported by ATel #12155. 

The spectra may resemble those of a young nova event, most likely a classical
Fe nova.  However, the ejecta velocities are quite modest, and the  
current absolute magnitude of the transient, M(r) ~ -9.7 mag obtained assuming
a host galaxy distance of 3 Mpc, would pose the object in luminous  
tail of nova distribution. Its high luminosity combined with a modest line
velocity indicate this is a non-standard event (Payne-Gaposchkin 1957).

Other types of eruptive variables are still possible. A recurrent nova
similar to T Pyx has also been proposed in ATel #12155, but that nova was

fainter, and the early spectra showed He lines. Alternatively, the spectrum
and the absolute magnitude of AT 2018hrg are also consistent with those

of a very early luminous red nova or even an LBV outburst (e.g. Smith et
al.2011, MNRAS, 415, 773). However, the S0 host galaxy type and the lack

of luminous stellar counterparts in archive HST images make the latter
scenario less plausible. Finally, we cannot even rule out a transient of
the  
Galactic halo projected towards NGC 404. Further observations to clarify
the nature of this object are encouraged. <br />

ATEL #12152,Optical,"
We obtained an optical spectrum (range 390-860 nm) of SN 2018hmx (=ATLAS18xos),
discovered by ATLAS, on UT October 30.8 2018 with the Xinglong 2.16-m telescope
(+BFOSC) of National Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC). The spectrum
is consistent with a type IIP supernova at a few days before maximum. Cross
correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification""
code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matched
SN 1999em at about t=-4 days before the maximum light. After correcting
for a redshift of 0.037 for its host galaxy SDSS J083337.65+553532.1, an
expansion velocity of about 17000 km/s can be derived from the absorption
minium of Ha line, which is unusually high for a SN IIP at this phase.

ATEL #12151,X-ray,"
The hard X-ray transient monitor of the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
has detected a previously unknown transient source. The new source, Swift
J1858.6-0814, was first detected by the BAT in a 1-day integration on 2018
October 25 (MJD 58416) at an average rate of 0.0056 +/- 0.0013 counts/sec/cm2
(25 mCrab) in the 15-50 keV band. It has risen in brightness since that
time. On 2018 October 31, the rate was 0.0094 +/- 0.0024 counts/sec/cm2
(43 mCrab).  

The best BAT position is (J2000):

RA = 284.673   Dec= -8.245

RA = 18 58 41.5  Dec =	-08 14 42.0

with an estimated error of 3 arc minutes (statistical plus systematic).
This corresponds to galactic coordinates  L=26.395, B=-5.351.  Given
the proximity to the galactic plane, we tentatively identify this source
as a galactic X-ray transient. 

Swift Target of Opportunity observations have been requested.

ATEL #12148,Gamma Ray,"
AGILE is detecting a renewed and intense gamma-ray flare above 100 MeV
from the direction of the Crab Nebula. 

Integrating from 2018-10-27 18:44 UT to 2018-10-29 18:44 UT, a maximum
likelihood analysis yields a detection at a significance level of about
8 sigma, and a flux F = (0.9 +/- 0.2) x 10^-5 ph/cm^2/s (E > 100 MeV).
This is a factor of about four larger than the average flux (2.2 +/- 0.1)
x 10^-6 ph/cm^2/s (E > 100 MeV) reported in the First AGILE catalog.  

Recent gamma-ray flaring episodes were recorded in ATel #12095,  ATel #12105
and ATel #12123.  

The AGILE-GRID detection was obtained while AGILE is observing in spinning
mode, surveying a large fraction of the sky each day. The source can be
monitored with the public mobile application ""AGILEScience"" developed by
the AGILE Team, available for both Android and iOS devices.

near-infrared wavelengths in the framework of the Optical and Infrared

Synergetic Telescopes for Education and Research (OISTER). 
This source is the closest Fermi source which is categorized as an unidentified

source in the 3FGL catalog (Acero et al. 2015) to the 
central position of the IceCube localization (1.3 degrees from best 
fit refined direction). and was encouraged for follow-up observations (Blaufuss
et al. 2018, GCN 23375). 

The positional uncertainty of the source is about 11 arcmin in  
diameter (95% CL), and we covered the several to 10 arcmin field of view
mostly centered on the source position.  
We covered about 10x10 arcmin^2 region centered on the source position.

Considering the moderately large Galactic extinction 
(Av~3.1; Schlafly et al. 2011), we prioritized the redder-band filters.

We performed quick analyses of the imaging data and  
do not find any significant transients compared to the PS1 catalog.

The Spectral Classification of Astronomical Transients (SCAT) survey (ATel
#11444) presents the classification of 5 optical transients. We report
optical spectroscopy (330-970nm) taken with the University of Hawaii 88-inch
(UH88) telescope using the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS).
Transients were classified using the SuperNova IDentification code (SNID,
Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). Redshifts given to 2 decimal places
are derived using supernova lines, otherwise host galaxy lines are used
or taken from NED if available.

ATEL #12141,Optical,"
We obtained an optical spectrum (range 350-890 nm) of AT 2018hlr (=PTSS-18jmj),
discovered by PTSS (PMO-THU Supernova Survey), on UT Oct 22.5 2018 with
the Lijiang 2.4-m telescope (LJT+YFOSC) at Gaomeigu Station of Yunnan Observatories
(YNAO). The spectrum is consistent with that of a SN 1991T/1999aa-like
type Ia supernova around the maximum light. Cross correlation with a library
of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin
and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matched SN 2005M at about
3 days before the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift of 0.059
for its host galaxy SDSS J182033.43+415807.3 (from the SNID fit), an expansion
velocity of about 10500 km/s be derived from the absorption minimum of
Si II 6355 line. 

"
ATEL #12142,Optical,"
We report on optical spectroscopic observations of PNV J16143400-5330050
confirming its classical nova classification. The transient was reported
by R. Kaufman on 2018-10-13.414 UT (V ~ 10.5) as a possible nova. Confirmation
images and a low-resolution spectrum were obtained by S. Kiyota. The nova
has faded by more than 2 mag in the last 10 days.  

We obtained a 30 s low resolution spectrum of the source with the Goodman
spectrograph on the SOAR telescope on 2018-10-23.03 UT. The spectrum is
dominated by emission lines of H I, Fe II, Al II, Na I, Si II, and O I
(see below a full list of the line identification). We measure a FWHM of
~2800 &plusmn; 100 km/s (for Halpha). No P Cygni profiles were detected.
The spectrum is that of a classical nova from the Fe II (broad) spectroscopic
class, possibly in the transition phase. The FWHM of Halpha indicates high
ejection velocity consistent with the fast evolution of the light-curve.
Further spectroscopic follow-up are required to track the evolution of
the nova, but this source is approaching solar conjunction. 

We also report on improved coordinates of the nova (RA 16:14:32.9; Dec
-53:30:15.2) with uncertainty of about 0.2'' per coordinate.

We report the optical spectroscopic observation of the supernova candidate
ASASSN-18vo/2018gkj (ATel #12063) using SALT/RSS (350.0-920.0 nm) on UT
2018-10-20.76. The target was discovered by All-Sky Automated Survey for
Supernovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014). We used SNID (Blondin & Tonry,
2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) to identify the type, phase, and redshift of the
SN spectra. 
<br/> 
The spectrum matches with SNe Ia about a month after the peak and is consistent
with the host redshift of 0.0416 (NED)

ATEL #12138,Optical,"
We conducted spectroscopic observations of seven Local Group nova candidates
using the SPRAT instrument (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9147E..8HP"">Piascik
et al. 2014</a>) on the 2m-robotic Liverpool Telescope (LT; <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5489..679S"">Steele
et al. 2004</a>). Each spectral observation is preceded by a series of
(typically at least 3) 10s acquisition images taken either by SPRAT (unfiltered)
or <a href=""http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/TelInst/Inst/IOO/"">IO:O</a> through
a Sloan-<it>r'</it> filter. Each spectrum consists of 3&times;600s or 3&times;900s
exposure time using the blue-optimised mode of SPRAT.  

We attempted to obtain a spectrum of AT2018hfs on 2018-10-15.97 UT, but
the object is barely visible in the acquisition images. AT2018gqg and AT2018had
were observed at 2018-09-22.95 and 2018-10-04.12 UT respectively. A faint
continuum is detected in each case, but the S/N is too low for a classification.
AT2018hho was observed at 2018-10-16.94 UT. We detect a H&alpha; emission
line with FWHM ~ 3100 km/s. A spectrum of AT2018hcd taken 2018-10-16.98
UT shows a red continuum. The S/N is low, but there is tentative evidence
for TiO absorption bands, indicating the transient is likely a red LPV.

We obtained a spectrum of AT2018hhy at 2018-10-17.99 UT, which shows TiO
absorption bands on a red continuum, indicating that this object is a red
LPV. We also note that there is a variable coincident with the position
of AT2018hhy in <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AJ....121..870M"">Macri
et al. (2001)</a> and <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.371.1405H"">Hartman
et al. (2006)</a>. 

We obtained a spectrum of AT2018hld at 2018-10-18.89 UT. The spectrum shows
strong Balmer emission and we measure the H&alpha; FWHM ~ 2300 km/s. The
spectrum also shows numerous Fe II emission lines, including those of the
42, 48, 49 and 74 multiplets, along will O I 7774 &Aring; (the latter of
which seems to show a P-Cygni profile). The spectrum confirms AT2018hld
is a nova in M31 and a member of the Fe II spectroscopic class. The spectrum
is also broadly similar with that obtained around one day earlier by Robin
Leadbeater (see AT2018hld TNS page). 

The objects that we were able to classify are summarised below:

V-band observations by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN;
Shappee et al. 2014, ApJ, 788, 48; Kochanek et al. 2017, PASP, 129, 104502)
show that the cataclysmic variable WX Arietis (hereinafter, WX Ari) faded
by ~0.3 magnitudes at some point during its solar conjunction in 2018 and
then by another ~0.3 magnitudes in early-to-mid August 2018. Since then,
it has remained stable near V~15.3, consistent with a drop in the binary's
mass-transfer rate. A well-known member of the SW Sextantis class of cataclysmic
variables, WX Ari is an eclipsing novalike system and is normally characterized
by a high mass-transfer rate (see D. W. Hoard's ""Big List of SW Sextantis
Stars"" at https://www.dwhoard.com/biglist; Hoard et al. 2003, AJ, 126,
2473).  

To assess the notability of the current fading episode, we retrieved the
long-term light curve of WX Ari from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey
(CRTS; Drake et al. 2009, ApJ, 696, 870) and combined it with the ASAS-SN
V-band light curve, obtaining a baseline of observations that extends back
to 2005. In addition to showing that WX Ari spends most of its time near
V~14.7, the combined light curve contains three low states: a pair of extremely
faint states with a maximum depth of over 2.5 mag, and a partially observed
low state in 2005 that was only 0.5 mag deep. The two extremely low states,
which lasted from 2012-2013 and 2013-2016, were separated by a temporary
bright state during which WX Ari returned to its typical luminosity. It
is unclear whether the ongoing fade is simply a shallow low state (similar
to the 2005 event) or a prelude to an extremely faint state, but continued
ASAS-SN observations should provide the answer. 

The linked figure is a two-page PDF containing (1) the combined ASAS-SN/CRTS
light curve and (2) the ASAS-SN V- and g-band light curve from 2018 only.
The large gap in the latter is due to solar conjunction.

GWAC (Wei et al., 2016) auto-discovery system discover an outburst of the
source, whose coordinates are RA=02:25:06.4 DEC=+08:06:39 J2000 on 2018-10-17T13:55:00
UT. There is a source in VIZIER database within an error circle radius
of 0.5 arcsec. The brightness of the counterpart in USNO B1.0 catalog is
R1=19.93 mag.

The multi wavelength photometry observations were performed 
with 0.6m GWAC_F60B telescope 65sec after the event at Xinglong 
observatory, operated by the National Observatories of China and the Guangxi

University. The brightness of this optical transient is about 14.4 mag
in R band during the observation epoch and has a variation of about 0.4
mag. All these magnitudes are calibrated by the nearby USNO B1.0 magnitudes.

The spectrum of the transient was obtained by the 2.16m telescope of 
Xinglong observatory, National Astronomical Observatories, CAS, on 2018-10-17.

The beginning time of the spectrum was 16:35:13UT. The exposure time was
30 min.  
The OMR spectrograph was used in the observation. The spectral resolution
is 
~10A, and is blazed at 6000A. The transient shows a very blue continuum

superposed by evident Ha, Hb, and HeII4686A emission lines. The Ha 
emission line is double peaked. The spectrum is consistent with the feature
of a dwarf nova.

ATEL #12136,Gamma Ray,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), the principal instrument on-board the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed increasing gamma-ray flux from
a source positionally consistent with PKS 1830-211 (also known as 3FGL
J1833.6-2103, Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 2,  placed at RA: 18h 33m 39.9s,
Dec -21d 03m 40s, J2000, van Ommen et al., 1995, ApJ, 444, 561). 

Preliminary analysis indicates that the source on October 18, 2018 showed
a significantly increased daily average gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (2.8+/0.3)
x10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (errors are statistical only), more than a factor
of 4 greater than the average flux reported in the  Third Fermi LAT catalog
(3FGL). It was detected also on October 19 with an average flux of of (1.7+/-0.3)
x10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1.  This source is one of the ""LAT Monitored Sources""
and consequently a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed
by Fermi-LAT is publicly available (link: http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/
). 

PKS 1830-211 (z=2.507, Lovell et al. 1998, ApJ, 508, L51) is a flat spectrum
radio quasar located behind the southern Galactic Bulge with gravitational
magnification and absorption features. It is gravitationally lensed by
a galaxy at z=0.886 (Wiklind & Combes 1996, Nature, 379, 11).  It showed
bright GeV gamma-ray flares detected by the LAT in October 2010 (ATel #2943
), June 2012 (ATel #4158) and in July  2014 (ATel #6361). A gamma-ray flare
was also detected by AGILE in October 2009 (ATel #2242). 

Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring
of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity
of this source we encourage multi-wavelength observations. For this source
the Fermi-LAT contact person is S. Ciprini  (stefano.ciprini@asdc.asi.it).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

on UT Oct 19.8 2018 with the 2.16-m telescope (+BFOSC) at Xinglong Station
of National Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC). The spectrum is
consistent with that of a type IIb supernova at a few weeks after the maximum
light. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the
comparison tool ""GELATO"" (Harutyunyan et al., 2008, A&A, 488, 383) shows
that it matches with SN 2011fu at t=+41 days from the explosion. After
correcting for a redshift of 0.0168 for its host galaxy UGC 04344, an expansion
velocity of about 9600 km/s can be derived from the absorption minimum
of Ha line.

SN 2018aad (ASASSN-18eo; Nicholls et al. 2018, ATel #11391) was classified
as a Type II supernova at z=0.01 (<a href=""https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018aad/classification-cert"">Hosseinzadeh
et al. 2018, TNSCR 1784</a>) based on a broad H-alpha P-Cygni feature.
Later spectra indeed show typical Type IIP SN features but the narrower
lines allow a better redshift determination at z=0.025. This redshift puts
the light curve peak at an absolute magnitude of ~-19, which is atypically
high for Type IIP SNe. We find an expansion velocity of 8000 km/s for H-alpha
(from the minimum of the P-Cygni absorption trough) at >200 days post discovery,
which is also atypically high for a Type IIP SN at that stage. Superfit
(<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...634.1190H"">Howell et
al. 2005, ApJ, 634, 1190</a>) finds matches to this H-alpha velocity with
Type IIP SNe just 15-20 days post explosion. In addition, the light curve
declined from a broad peak or plateau but ~50 days ago seems to have flattened
and started rising again. All of these characteristics, together with a
faint host galaxy, are similar to what was seen for the very peculiar supernova
iPTF14hls (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017Natur.551..210A"">Arcavi

all wavelengths is strongly encouraged.

The Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) Unbiased Transient Survey (NUTS; ATel

discovered by Gaia on 2018-10-10.8 with a Gaia G-band magnitude of 17.16,
and located in the Seyfert-2 galaxy ESO 417-G-006 (via SIMBAD). 

Observations were performed with the 2.56 m Nordic Optical Telescope equipped
with ALFOSC (range 350-950 nm; resolution 1.6-nm FWHM) on 2018-10-19.1
UT. Inspection of the spectrum reveals Gaia18czg/SN 2018hib is a Type-Ia
supernova around maximum light. Comparison with a library of template supernovae
spectra using SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007) reveals good mataches with
SN 2006gr and SN 2006S several days before maximum light.  Adopting a red-shift
of z=0.016 (De Vaucouleurs et al. 1991, Third Reference Catalogue of Bright
Galaxies, Version 3.9), the location of maximum absorption of the SiII
635.5-nm profile suggests a blue-shifted Doppler velocity of approximately
-10,500 km/s.

ATEL #12122,Optical,"
We obtained SALT (+RSS) spectroscopy of ASASSN-18yc (= SN 2018hkx; ATel
#12119) on 2018 October 18.0 UT, covering the wavelength range 350-940
nm. Cross-correlation of the supernova spectrum with a template library
using SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows a good match to
the type-Ia SN 1999ee at -7 days relative to maximum light. We also placed
the longslit through the nucleus of the host galaxy 2MASX J04005460-6640336
and derive a heliocentric redshift of 7515 +/- 30 km/s using cross-correlation
with galaxy templates. The expansion velocity of the supernova (measured
to the trough of the Si II rest 635.5 nm line) is approximately 11,600
km/s, though the line profile is somewhat asymmetric. Given the location
of ASASSN-18yc in the TESS Camera 4 continuous viewing zone, further follow-up
observations of this supernova are encouraged.

ATEL #12123,Gamma Ray,"
AGILE is detecting an intense gamma-ray flare above 100 MeV from the direction
of the Crab Nebula. 

Integrating from 2018-10-16 22:49 UT to 2018-08-17 22:49 UT, a maximum
likelihood analysis yields a detection at a significance level of about
5.5 sigma, and a flux F = (1.1 +/- 0.4) x 10^-5 ph/cm^2/s (E > 100 MeV).
This is greater of a factor 5 than the average flux (2.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^-6
ph/cm^2/s (E > 100 MeV) reported in the First AGILE catalog. 

The AGILE-GRID detection was obtained while AGILE is observing in spinning
mode, surveying a large fraction of the sky each day. The source can be
monitored with the public mobile application ""AGILEScience"" developed by
the AGILE Team, available for both Android and iOS devices.

FIRST J141918.9+394036 has been reported as a slowly-evolving extragalactic
radio transient <a href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018arXiv180808964L/"">(Law
et al. 2018, arXiv:1808.08964)</a>, consistent with a fading orphan long
gamma-ray burst (LGRB).</br></br> 

Here we report observations performed at 1.6 GHz with the European VLBI
Network in real time (e-EVN) on 18 September 2018 from 12:00 to 19:00 UTC.
These observations provide milliarcsecond resolution (the synthesized
beam is 5.0 x 7.3 mas with a position angle of 75 degrees) with an rms
noise level of 45 &mu;Jy/beam.</br></br> 

We detected radio emission with a flux density of approximately 520 &mu;Jy,
at a best-fit position of:</br></br> 

ra = 14h19m18.85075(5)s</br> 
dec = +39d40'36.0492(4)''</br></br> 

This is consistent in flux density and position with the source reported
in <a href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018arXiv180808964L/"">Law
et al. (2018, arXiv:1808.08964)</a>.</br></br> 

We constrain the source size to be approximately less than or equal to
4 mas, by using modelfit in the uv-plane with a circular Gaussian.  Given
the distance to FIRST J141918.9+394036 of 87 Mpc <a href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018arXiv180808964L/"">(Law
et al. 2018, arXiv:1808.08964)</a>, the constraint on the angular size
implies a physical size of < 1.7 pc.  These results will be used to help
distinguish between GRB and magnetar models.</br></br> 

Additional technical details: The observation was conducted at a bitrate
of 1024 Mbps, with a total bandwidth of 128 MHz divided into 8 IFs of 64
channels each. The total on-source time was 4.8 h. J1419+3821 was used
as phase calibrator in a phase-reference cycle of 4.5 min on target and
1.5 min on calibrator. The participating telescopes were Effelsberg (Germany),
Westerbork Single Telescope (Netherlands), Jodrell Bank Mk2 Telescope (UK),

ATEL #12128,Optical,"
We report on optical observations of the transient black hole binary (BHB)
candidate MAXI J1820+070 (ASASSN-18ey), in outburst since March 2018 (ATel
#11399, #11400).

Since the outburst started, we have been monitoring the field of the target
in the optical using the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) 1- and 2-m telescopes
(g', r', i', y bands), and with the Meade LX850 16-inch (41-cm) telescope
of the Al Sadeem Observatory (UAE), using the 'blue', 'green' and 'red'
Baader LRGB CCD-Filters (that approximately correspond to the central wavelengths
of the g', V and R filters, respectively).  
The optical counterpart was always well detected, allowing us to follow
the evolution of the outburst at these wavelenghts, and to compare it to
the X-rays (see ATel #11418, #11533).

After the detection of the hard-to soft transition in the X-rays (MJD 58300;
ATel #11820), the optical fluxes followed a decreasing trend with time,
similarly to what is observed in the soft X-rays. 

Around September 22nd (MJD 58383), a significant increase in the hard X-rays
has been reported by the MAXI team (ATel #12057), suggesting for a transition
to the hard-intermediate state (see also ATel #12064). After the transition,
MAXI J1820+070 was detected in the radio on MJD 58384 by the Arcminute
Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA; Atel #12061), with an integrated
flux of 910+/-70 uJy. This radio detection is a clear indication that the
jet has reactivated in the radio at the passage from the soft to hard-intermediate
state.

At the time of the radio detection, the optical fluxes that we obtained
from our monitoring kept on decreasing, reaching the minimum flux on MJD
58396 (a delay in the optical flux rise with respect to the radio due to
the reactivation of the jet is typically observed in BHBs; see Kalemci
et al. 2013, ApJ, 779, 95). We report here the corresponding magnitudes
of the target, obtained with the LCO 1-m telescope, calibrated against
a group of PanStarrs bright stars in the field:

g'=14.62 +/- 0.01

i'=14.55 +/- 0.05

r'=14.64 +/- 0.02

y=14.57 +/- 0.04 

The first signs of the reactivation of the jet at optical frequencies happened
to be on October 12th (MJD 58403). Here follow the magnitudes (Al Sadeem
Telescope) on that epoch, showing the increase of the flux: 

R = 14.08+/- 0.03

g' = 14.16 +/- 0.02 

Here also follow the AB magnitudes of MAXI J1820+070 obtained with the
LCO two days later, on MJD 58405 (October 14th), that are still consistent
with a rise of the optical flux:

g'=14.17 +/- 0.01

i'=13.94 +/- 0.04

r'=14.06 +/- 0.02

y=13.72 +/- 0.03 

Besides the increased optical flux, we also notice that the color of the
source has changed, with the spectrum becoming more red. This is a strong
evidence of the reactivation of the jet also at optical frequencies.

Our last Al Sadeem Observatory observations, moreover, are consistent with
a flattening of the light curves, with the following measured magnitudes:

R = 13.86+/- 0.02

g' = 14.19 +/- 0.04 

This suggests that the flux is now peaking and may start to decay.

Further multiwavelength observations are strongly encouraged to confirm
the peak and decay of the optical flux.

ATEL #12129,X-ray,"
The Swift/BAT team have examined the BAT data record around the time of
the flare of FSRQ SDSS J002829.81+200026.7, reported by Sun et al. (ATel
#12120).  We find that the flux increase reported is most likely due a
known instrumental effect of electronic noise (hot pixels), which caused
an increase in BAT's gross count rate. 

On-board processing shows no detection of any activity at the reported
location, either at the reported time or earlier in the mission. 

We therefore conclude that the reported flare is very likely not of astrophysical
origin.

At UTC 2018-10-16-04:16:56.3 (2018-10-16.1795823), we found a bright fast
radio burst as part of the ongoing search program (UTMOST), at the Molonglo
telescope. 

A second, unrelated FRB (FRB181017) was found the following day at UTC
2018-10-17-10:24:37.4 (2018-10-17.4337662). 

Molonglo is a 1.6 km long East-West array (Bailes et al 2017, PASA, 34,
45) and was operating in drift-scan mode with pointing centred on the meridian
at the time of detection. Source localisation is excellent in Right Ascension
(5 arcsec at 1-sigma) but poor in 
Declination (~1.2 deg at 1-sigma) (see Caleb et al 2017 MNRAS 468, 3746).

FRB181016
and 
FRB181017
were found during a blind FRB search programme in real-time using an automated
GPU-accelerated/machine learning based pipeline and the raw voltages were
recorded for offline processing. 

FRB181016
: The optimal dispersion measure (DM) that maximizes the signal-to-noise
ratio is: 1984 pc cm^-3. The DM estimate of NE2001 model is ~90 pc cm^-3,
and YMW16 model is ~69 pc cm^-3 at this position, resulting in an intergalactic
excess of ~1900 pc cm^-3. The upper limit on the DM-inferred redshift is
thus z ~ 1.8. 

An early estimate (lower limit) of the event's apparent fluence is ~ 70
Jy ms (corrected for attenuation of the primary beam in the RA direction,
but not in the Dec direction), width ~ 6.88 ms, with a detection signal-to-noise
ratio = 20. 

The most likely position is RA = 15:46:20.5, DEC = -25:24:32, J2000, Galactic:
Gl = 345.51 deg, Gb = 22.67 deg. The 95% confidence localisation arc is

: The dispersion measure (DM) that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio
is: 240 pc cm^-3. The DM estimate of NE2001 model is ~38 pc cm^-3, and
YMW16 model is ~27 pc cm^-3 at the position of the FRB, resulting in an
intergalactic excess of ~205 pc cm^-3. The upper limit on the DM-inferred
redshift is thus z ~ 0.2. 

An early estimate (lower limit) of the event's apparent fluence is ~ 95
Jy ms (corrected for attenuation of the primary beam in the RA direction,
but not in the Dec direction), width ~ 2.6 ms, with a signal-to-noise ratio

emission with the photon index of 2 and HI column density  
of 8.14x10^21 cm^-2 this translates to the unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV

~100 outburst (Stanek et al. ATel #12082). Fermi-LAT reported that this
source was in a gamma-ray high state during October 3-5, 2018 (Buson et
al. ATel #12084), with a peak gamma-ray flux on October 4. Swift/XRT observations
in October 8-9 have shown the source was under a decay in soft X-rays(Komossa
et al. ATel #12094). We have investigated the observations in the same
period by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board Neil Gehrels Swift observatory.
We found BAT had also observed a extreme hard X-ray (15-150 keV) flare
from a source coincident with the position of SDSS J002829.81+200026.7
at (R.A., Dec) = (7.124 deg, -20.007 deg)(J2000). The BAT peak flux of
the flare was 13.3 +- 0.2 Crab (14.0-194.9 keV, 1 sigma error) on 2018-10-05.59265
UT. The rise of the bright hard X-ray flare was extremely rapid. The flux
increased by a factor of 9.7 in about 280 seconds, and then decreased by
a factor of 31 in < 4300 seconds. In the period between the BAT observation
of the apparent flare peak and the following BAT survey observations, the
source was outside the field of view of BAT. The entire duration of the
hard X-ray flare is thus estimated shorter than about 76 minutes. Such
a bright hard X-ray flare and its fast rise and rapid decay, are very rare
for flares seen in quasars. The hard X-ray flare is probably associated
with some violent jet activities, which deserves further multi-wavelength
and multi-messenger investigations. 

We would like to mention that the source is also known as TXS 0025+197
(Douglas et al. 1996 AJ, 111.1945D). We thank the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory
for kindly providing the data to the public.

AG Peg is an unique symbiotic star that experienced a nova outburst in
the mid-19th century and two  brightness maxima in 2015 that are typical
for the classical symbiotic stars. Recently, Zhekov & Tomov (2018, MNRAS,
481, 5156) reported UV flickering variability with an amplitude of about
0.1 mag on a time-scales of minutes-hours. 

We searched for optical flickering variability on time-scale of minutes
with the 50/70 Schmidt telescope of the Rozhen NAO on October 8, 2018.
For 150 minutes, we have secured 400 exposures with exposure time of 6
seconds in the B band. Aperture photometry was performed using HD 207860
as a comparison star adopting B=9.169 mag.   

We do not detect optical flickering (see Fig. 1). The upper limit of the
amplitude is 0.02 mag (20 mmag). 

Probably, the accretion disc around the white dwarf  is very hot and the
flickering is visible only in the UV, but not in the optical bands yet.
Another explanation could be the different sites of origin and/or different
mechanisms for the flickering activity in the UV and the optical bands.

ATLAS is a twin 0.5m telescope system on Haleakala and Mauna Loa which

is robotically surveying the sky above declination -40 with a cadence 
of 2 days (Tonry et al. 2018, PASP, 13, 064505). Two filters are used,

cyan and orange (denoted c and o; all mags quoted are in the AB

Objects, we search for and publicly report stationary transients to 
the IAU Transient Name Server. More information is on 
http://www.fallingstar.com. We are submitting Astronomer's Telegrams 
for transients that are either within 100 Mpc, or have some other 
interesting feature to bring to the community's attention, such as 
bright nuclear transients, slowly rising or rapidly fading objects. 

We report a new transient source, most likely a supernova in the

ATEL #12117,X-ray,"
MAXI/GSC detected a bright X-ray-burst-like event from the Galactic center
region in the scan transit at 17:18 UT on 2018 October 14. 
Assuming that the source flux was constant over the transit, we obtain
the source position at

(R.A., Dec) = (265.734 deg, -29.891 deg) = (17 42 56, -29 53 27) (J2000)

equivalently

(l, b) = (358.880 deg, -0.001 deg) = (358 52 49.2, -00 00 04)

with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short
radii of 0.38 deg and 0.19 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long
axis from the north direction is 59.0 deg counterclockwise. These errors
are for the J2000 equatorial coordinate system. There is an additional
systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius). The X-ray flux
averaged over the scan was 297 +- 38 mCrab (4.0-10.0keV, 1 sigma error).

Without assumptions on the source constancy, we obtain a rectangular error
box for the transient source with the following corners: 

(R.A., Dec) = (265.477, -28.919) deg = (17 41 54, -28 55 08) (J2000)

(R.A., Dec) = (264.748, -29.359) deg = (17 38 59, -29 21 32) (J2000)

(R.A., Dec) = (265.706, -30.556) deg = (17 42 49, -30 33 21) (J2000)

(R.A., Dec) = (266.439, -30.110) deg = (17 45 45, -30 06 35) (J2000)

There was no significant excess flux in the previous transit at UT 15:45
and in the next transit at 18:50 UT with an upper limit of 20 mCrab for
each.

Because of the Galactic center region, there are a number of sources inside
the error box. Our bright and transient X-ray source catalogue (see Negoro
et al. 2016, PASJ, 68, S1 in detail) contains three sources in the error
box,  the black hole candidate 1E 1740.7-2942 (laying 0.26 deg from the
above source position), the dim X-ray transient Swift J174444.9-295042
(0.40 deg; see Bandyopadhyay et al. ATel #4111), and the possible black
hole transient EXS 1737.9-2952 (0.40 deg; Durouchoux et al. 1998, ApJ 507,
781). If this transient activity is really an X-ray burst (see below),
it may be suggested that Swift J1744 is a neutron star and gave rise to
this burst. 
We, however, tentatively name the source MAXI J1724-298 until the identification.

Preliminary spectral analysis shows the GSC spectrum of this event can
be represented by an absorbed blackbody model with a temperature of 1.6
+/- 0.4 keV and a column density nH of (1.8 +/- 1.6)e22 atoms/cm^2. The
absorbed and unabsorbed 2-10 keV fluxes are 5.4e-9 erg/cm^2/s and 1.1e-8
erg/cm^2/s, respectively. Thus, the spectrum is a typical spectrum of X-ray
bursts. Significant time variations were, however, not recognized during
the scan transit for about 100 sec. This may indicate that we observed
a tail of a relatively long X-ray burst. The upper limit of the source
distance calculating the above flux on the assumption of the Eddington
luminosity of a neutron star with 1.4 solar mass is 10.2 kpc.

Followup observations are encouraged.

Our latest observations carried out with the CCD photometer of 1-meter
reflector of SAO RAS allow us to conclude about a new active phase of the
blazar [hb89]0234+285 also known as the radio and gamma source (4C+28.07
and 3FGLJ0237.9+2848, respectively). Its last activity period in the IR
range was noticed by Carrasco et al. (Atel #11261) in the last February.

All the data obtained in every night since October, 6 till October, 13
indicate the brightness of the source in the range between 14m.0 and 14m.5
in the R band. Usually, blazar's brightness is about 17m (R-band). The
maximum brightness of [hb89]0234+285 was detected in October, 9 and even
exceeded 14m (13.95m at MJD=58401.5868). 

Hence, the source has increased its flux by a factor of 3 magnitudes with
respect to its quiet state. We should note also that the blazar demonstrated
the significant intra-day variability too: its flux changed within the
0m.25 range in course of our 3--4 hour studies on October, 9 and 11, respectively.

Latest measurements have showed that [hb89]0234+285 has become fainter---now
its flux is decreasing to R=14m.7. 

All the magnitudes were calibrated using standard stars from the PG0220+132
field of Landolt (1992, AJ 104, p.340). We shall continue studying the
source in following nights. Also, multi-wavelength follow-up is warmly
encouraged.

AGILE is monitoring the current episode of enhanced gamma-ray emission
from the Crab Nebula as first reported by Fermi-LAT (ATel #12095). 

Integrating from 2018-10-09 15:50 UT to 2018-10-11 15:50 UT, the AGILE/GRID
detects a total (pulsar + Nebula) gamma-ray flux: F = (5.6 +/- 1.4) x 10^-6
ph cm^-2 s^-1 (E > 100 MeV) at 6.7 sigma. This flux level is consistent
with the previously reported value in ATel #12095, and is a factor of ~2
greater than the average gamma-ray flux. 

This measurement was obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of the
sky in spinning mode. 

Multifrequency observations of the Crab Nebula are strongly encouraged.

such behavior is very rarely seen for AGN or quasars (e.g, ATel

During the ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, <a
href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/%61bs/2014ApJ...788...48S"">Shappee et al.
2014</a>), using data from the quadruple 14-cm ""Payne-Gaposchkin"" telescope
in Sutherland, South Africa, we discovered a new transient source, most
likely a supernova, in the galaxy 2MASX J00420581-0237394. 

ASASSN-18xr (AT 2018hgc)  was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-10-10.04
at g~18.2 mag. We also detect the object in images obtained on UT 2018-10-09.06
(g~17.8). We do not detect (g>18.2) the object in images taken on UT 2018-10-08.05
and before. An image obtained on 2018-10-11 confirms the discovery of the
transient. This <a href=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/assassin/followup/asassn-18xr.png>figure</a>
shows the archival DSS image of the host (left) and the confirmation image
(right). The red circle has a radius of 5"" and is centered on the position
of the transient in the confirmation image. 

The position of ASASSN-18xr is approximately 5.1"" South and 19.0"" West
from the center of the galaxy 2MASX J00420581-0237394 (z=0.051782, d=216

ATEL #12092,X-ray,"
We report on the observations of the X-ray outbursts from two Be/X-ray
binary pulsars triggered by the MAXI/GSC nova-alert system (Negoro et al.
2016, PASJ, 68, S1). 

The X-ray brightening of A 0535+26 was triggered on 2018-09-22 (MJD 58383).
According to the 4-10 keV data extracted from the MAXI/GSC On-demand system
with the modified background region, the present outburst started from
2018-09-20 (MJD 58381), and the flux reached 0.0473 +- 0.0170 ph/s/cm<sup>2</sup>
(41 +- 15 mCrab) on 2018-09-24 (MJD 58385).  The onset date of the current
outburst corresponds to the orbital phase of ~0.06, which is derived from
following orbital parameters, T<sub>0</sub>=44943.5(MJD), P<sub>orb</sub>=111.0
d (Giovannelli et al. 2013, A&A, 560, 1).  The moderate flux increase rate
in 4-10 keV energy band is comparable to that of the normal outburst in
2014 (Nakajima et al. Atel#6569).  Therefore, we consider that the source
again exhibited the normal outburst since the last weak X-ray outburst
observed in October 2016 (Iwakiri et al. Atel#8977).  Because the source
region was in the out of the field of view from 2018-09-24 (MJD 58385),
the outburst peak was not observed by the MAXI/GSC.  Neil Gehrels Swift
observatory and Fermi/GBM also detected this X-ray brightening.  The 15-50
keV flux peaked at 2018-09-26 (MJD 58387), and faded on 2018-09-29 (MJD
58390). The day-averaged maximum flux was 0.0201 +/- 0.0025 counts/s/cm<sup>2</sup>
(91 +/- 11 mCrab).

The source light curves can be checked at the following pages;

MAXI(http://maxi.riken.jp/pubdata/v3.rkn/J0538+263/index.html), 

Swift/BAT(https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/1A0535p262/),

and

the BeXRB monitor page(http://integral.esac.esa.int/bexrbmonitor/webpage_oneplot.php)</a>.

A weak X-ray emission from GRO J1008-57 was triggered on 2018-09-30 (MJD
58391).  After the trigger, the source flux in 4-10 keV band started to
increase from 2018-10-04 (MJD 58395) and reached 0.1036 +- 0.0146 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup>
(89 +- 13 mCrab) on 2018-10-09 (MJD 58400).  The trigger date corresponds
to the orbital phase of ~0.9 (T<sub>0</sub>=54416.65 (MJD) and P<sub>orb</sub>=249.48
d (K&uuml;hnel et al. 2013).  The average flux increase rate in recent
days is ~0.015 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup>/day which is twice the nominal
value of the normal outburst of this source.  The 15-50 keV band data observed
by Swift/BAT also exhibits the high flux increase rate of ~0.008 count/s/day
(average rate of ~0.002 count/s/day).  Multi-wavelength observations are
encouraged to monitor this source 
activities.

is 
robotically surveying the sky above declination -40 with a cadence of 2
days 
(Tonry et al. 2018, PASP, 13, 064505). 
Two filters are used, cyan and orange (denoted c and o; all mags quoted

in the AB system). While carrying out the primary mission for Near Earth

Objects, we search for and publicly report stationary transients to the

IAU Transient Name Server.   
More information is on http://www.fallingstar.com. We are submitting  
Astronomer's Telegrams for transients that are either within 100 Mpc, 

or have some other interesting feature to bring to the community's  
attention, such as bright nuclear transients, slowly rising or  
rapidly fading objects.  

We report a new transient source, most likely a supernova in the galaxy

We have observed the flaring flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) SDSSJ002829.81+200026.7

(87GB 002553.4+194347; Gregory & Condon 1991) at redshift z=1.55 with the

Neil Gehrels Swift observatory on 2018 October 09 in all filters in the

optical and UV, and in the X-ray band.   

SDSSJ002829.81+200026.7 was detected in a rapid, unprecedented factor ~100
outburst  
with the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN; ATEL #12082)
with peak  
on 2018 October 05. It is now fading, and was accompanied by a gamma-ray
flare  
(ATEL #12084). 

With Swift, we detect the FSRQ at an X-ray countrate of (4.1+1.3-1.1)e-3
counts/s, 
marginally fainter than during an earlier Swift observation carried out
on  
2018 October 08 at (5.5+1.5-1.3)e-3 counts/s. Merging both observations,

we estimate a rather flat X-ray spectrum with photon index  
Gamma_x=1.3+/-0.3 (absorption fixed at the Galactic value), and an average

unabsorbed X-ray flux of 3.81e-13 erg/cm2/s in the observed (0.3-10) keV
band.  
The X-ray position of RA-2000: 00h 28m 29.77s, Dec-2000: +20deg 00' 24.7''

(90% confidence error radius of 4.4'', based on Evans et al. 2009) is consistent

with the optical SDSS position of this broad emission-line quasar.  

SDSSJ002829.81+200026.7 was detected in all optical/UV bands with Swift

at magnitudes in the Vega system of UVW2: 19.88+/-0.20 (19.21),  
UVM2: 18.99+/-0.11 (18.19), UVW1: 18.96+/-0.13 (18.40), U: 18.42+/-0.12
(17.97),  
B: 19.21+/-0.19 (18.86), and V: 18.52+/-0.23 (18.25) (uncorrected and corrected

for Galactic extinction, respectively) on 2018 October 09. This implies
a  
decline by 0.6 mag in the filter UVW1 which was chosen during the earlier,

independent Swift observation of October 08, and shows that the flare is
rapidly  
fading in the UV as well.

ATEL #12095,Gamma Ray,"
Preliminary Fermi LAT analysis reveals enhanced gamma-ray activity from
the direction of the Crab Nebula. The daily-averaged gamma-ray fluxes (E>100
MeV) from the direction of the Crab Nebula in the past three days were
5.6 +/- 0.2 (Oct 7), 5.0 +/- 0.4 (Oct 8), and  6.4 +/- 0.5 x 10^-6 ph cm^-2
s^-1  (Oct 9). These are a factor of ~2 greater than the average gamma-ray
flux of (2.71 +/- 0.02) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 reported in the third Fermi-LAT
source catalog (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23). The flux in the latest
6-hour interval on 2018 October 10 from 00h-04h UT was ~10 x 10^-6 ph cm^-2
s^-1. All fluxes given are the sums of the pulsar and nebular emission,
and with statistical uncertainties only.  

Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring
of this source will continue. This source is one of the ""LAT Monitored
Sources"" and consequently a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray
flux observed by Fermi LAT is publicly available (https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/source/Crab_Pulsar
). We strongly encourage further multifrequency observations of this region.
For this source the Fermi LAT contact person is Rolf Buehler (rolf.buehler@desy.de).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

ATEL #12097,Optical,"
CI Cam is a transient, which had a strong outburst in the wide range of
electromagnetic waves in April 1998. We have found previously that the
system consists of a B4 III-V star displaying B[e] phenomenon, and a white
dwarf on an eccentric orbit with the period of 19.407 days (ATel #416).
Additionally, it was shown that wind emission lines of Fe II and [N II]
5754 &Aring; shifted slowly in the spectra, and this shift reversed its
direction in 2007.  A treatment with the Doppler effect implies the presence
of a third companion in the system which passed the periastron in a close
approach that time (ATel #9663). Just after this event, the brightness
of the star increased gradually by 0.4 mag in the V band and reached maximum
in 2013. The star stays in the active state so far. Before the 2007 event,
CI Cam exhibited double-mode pulsations with the periods of 0.4152 and
0.2667 days with the full amplitudes of 0.019 and 0.017 mag in the V band,
correspondingly (ATel #1381). The ratio of periods of these waves was close
to 3:2, and their interaction had signs of resonance (CoAst #159, 71, 2009):
the amplitude of the light change increases several times when phases of
the waves coincide.

To verify the presence of pulsations in active state, we performed photometric
monitoring of CI Cam at the Crimean Astronomical Station of the Moscow
University. The observations were carried out with the 50 cm Maksutov meniscus
telescope and CCD Apogee Alta U8300 in the prime focus with the V filter
four nights in row from 4 to 7 October, 2018 (JD 2458396.43 - 2458399.62).
The interval of observations corresponds to the orbital phase range 0.44
- 0.61, around the white dwarf elliptical orbit apastron, when the orbital
light variations are minimum. An accuracy of the observations is 0.006
mag. We found regular pulsations only in a single mode with the period
of 0.4062 &plusmn; 0.0015, the moment of maximum brightness is JD 2458398.5245.
The light curve is slightly asymmetric. Amplitude of pulsations is 0.030
mag. So, in the active state with the brightness increase by 0.3 mag between
2006 and 2018, the pulsation period in this mode decreased by 2.5 &#37,
and amplitude increased by 60 &#37. The pulsations in the secondary mode
disappeared. This phenomenon suggests that pulsations are radial, and the
secondary mode was excited earlier due to a resonance. The CI Cam pulsation
is a unique phenomenon among B[e] stars. It rejects the classification
of this star as a sgB[e].

ATEL #12085,Supernovae,"
We obtained an optical spectrum (range 380-840 nm) of SN 2018hck (ASASSN-18xz),
discovered by All Sky Automated Survey for Supernova, on UT Oct.7.8 2018
with the Xinglong 2.16-m telescope (+BFOSC) of National Astronomical Observatories
of China (NAOC). The spectrum is consistent? with a type Ia supernova at
a few days after the maximum light. Cross-correlation? with a library of
supernova spectra using the comparison tool ""GELATO"" (Harutyunyan et al.,
2008, A&A, 488, 383) shows that it mathces ?with SN 2005am at t = +7.7
days from the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift of 0.033 for
its host galaxy 2MASX J04344671-1329047, an expansion velocity of about
12500 km/s can be derived from the absorption minimum of Si~II 635.5 nm

ATEL #12086,Optical,"
We have observed the blazar OJ 287 which has emerged after being Sun constrained
for 
~100 days with the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory. Between 2018 September
26 and October 6 it showed 
enhanced activity at all wavebands in comparison to its last Swift observation
on 2018 June 12.   
On 2018 September 26, its UVOT W2 magnitude was at 14.58 +/- 0.04 (corrected
for Galactic reddening,  
or a flux level of (1.51+/-0.04)e-11 erg/cm2/s), which is 0.25 magnitudes
brighter   
than during its last Swift observation, and the brightest level since February
2018.  
Other optical/UV magnitudes on 26 September were UVM2: 14.57+/-0.04 (14.33),
UVW1: 14.62+/-0.04 
(14.45), U: 14.50+/-0.04 (14.37), B: 15.37+/-0.04 (15.26), V: 15.03+/-0.05
(14.95)  
(uncorrected and corrected for Galactic reddening, respectively).  
In X-rays, OJ 287 on September 26 was detected at a countrate of 0.33
+/- 0.02 counts/s in  
the 0.3-10 keV band, 30% higher than during the observation  
on 2018 June 12. Fitting a single powerlaw with absorption fixed to the
Galactic value gives a photon  
index Gamma_x = 2.27 +/- 0.15, and an absorbed X-ray flux in the observed
(0.3-10) keV band of  
1.1e-11 erg/cm2/s. 
OJ 287 has shown repeated periods of high activity since its December
2015 outburst  
(e.g., ATEL #8378, ATEL #8372, ATEL #8411). Its current level of activity
is well below  
the highest states observed in 2016-2017 (e.g., ATEL #9629, ATEL #9650,
ATEL #9709, ATEL #10043).  
We have followed OJ 287 with Swift since December 2015 and found peak values
of 1.9 cts/s in  
X-ray countrate in February 2017 and 12.82 in UVW2 magnitude (corrected
for extinction) in  
October 2016.

ATEL #12082,Optical,"
During the ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, 
<A href=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/%61bs/2014ApJ...788...48S>Shappee et

al. 2014</a>), using data from the quadruple 14-cm ""Brutus"" telescope 
in Haleakala, Hawaii, we have discovered an unprecedented, factor of ~100

optical brightening of the QSO SDSS J002829.81+200026.7 (z=1.55).

SDSS J002829.81+200026.7, while <a 
href=http://nunuku.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/getcssconedb_release_img.cgi?&RA=7.12427&Dec=20.00758&Rad=0.17&DB=photcat&PLOT=plot&OUT=csv&SHORT=short>optically

variable in CRTS data</a>, it was never brighter than ~19 mag in these

data. Its g-band magnitude in SDSS data is g=20.6, its PS1 brightness 
is g=20.2, and its Gaia brightness is g=20.2. SDSS J002829.81+200026.7
started brightening rapidly on UT 2018-10-03.83, reaching V=15.5 on UT
2018-10-05.46, and then quickly 
decaying to g=16.5 on UT 2018-10-06.11 and g=17.6 on UT 2018-10-07.20 
(see its ASAS-SN Sky Patrol <a 
href=https://asas-sn.osu.edu/light_curves/a403bfeb-1dd4-4928-9d87-ac52263f0fb6>light

curve</a>). Such a rapid and dramatic brightening is unprecedented for
this 
object, which is classified by SDSS as ""QSO broadline"". 

In general, such behavior is rarely seen for any quasars (e.g., ATel #11110),
so 
multi-wavelength follow-up observations are encouraged.

We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their
continued support of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation through grant GBMF5490 to the Ohio State University,
NSF grant AST-1515927, the Mt. Cuba Astronomical Foundation, the Center
for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP) at OSU, the Chinese Academy
of Sciences South America Center for Astronomy (CASSACA), and the Villum
Fonden (Denmark).

ATEL #12084,Gamma Ray,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
has observed an increasing gamma-ray flux from a source positionally coincident
with SDSS J002829.81+200026.7 at RA: 00h 28m 29.8s, Dec. +20d 00m 27s (J2000);
(Beasley  et al. 2002 ApJS, 141, 13B). This is a flat spectrum radio quasar
also known as TXS 0025+197 (Douglas et al. 1996 AJ, 111.1945D), at redshift
of 1.552007  (Alam et al. 2015, ApJS, 219, 12).  

Preliminary analysis indicates that the source was in a high state between
October 3-5, 2018. On October 4 the source reached a peak gamma-ray flux
(E>100 MeV) of (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^-6 ph/cm^2/s (statistical uncertainty
only). This represents an increase by a factor of 50 over the average flux
reported in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL J0028.8+1951, Acero et al.
2015, ApJS, 218, 23). The enhanced state was characterized by a hard spectrum,
with average photon index of 1.7 +/- 0.1, significantly harder than the
3FGL average index of 2.4 +/- 0.1.  During the flare the LAT detected some
high-energy (>10 GeV) photons positionally consistent with this source.

The source was in an optical high state during these dates as reported
by ASAS-SN (Stanek et al. ATel #12082). 

Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring
of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity
of this source we strongly encourage multiwavelength observations. The
Fermi LAT contact persons are S. Buson (sara.buson at gmail.com) and R.
Angioni (angioni at mpifr-bonn.mpg.de).   

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan, and Sweden.

ATEL #12083,X-ray,"
Black hole X-ray transient 4U1630-47 is in outburst since June 6, 2018
(MJD 58275) according to MAXI monitoring. The count rate dropped sharply
after September 26, 2018 (MJD 58387), dropping to 0.2 photons s<sup>-1</sup>
cm<sup>-2</sup> from 0.9 photons s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> in 8 days.
After this sharp drop we triggered a target of opportunity observation
with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The observation taken on October
06, 2018  shows a soft spectrum that can be fitted with a diskbb. The disk
temperature is 1.06<span>&#177;</span>0.02 keV, the N<sub>H</sub> is 1.22E23
and 1-10 keV flux is 2.2 10<sup>-9</sup> ergs cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.

The source will be monitored further for possible signs of state change.

(3) The SN2018gex was discovered by ASAS-SN (ATel #12063), a classification
spectrum was obtained by ePESSTO on 2018-09-15 
(ATel #12040). The ePESSTO spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum
with H-alpha emission at z=0.03 (ATel #12040), 
however it was not possible to obtain a definitive classification. SN2018gex
evolved since then, and the spectrum 
obtained with Goodman corresponds to a SN type II, similar to SN2004et
after maximum. 
(4) SN2018cvn was discovered by ASAS-SN shortly after the SN explosion
(ATel #11832), then a few days later it was 
classified as a SN IIn a with Goodman at the SOAR telescope (ATel #11816).
The classification spectrum was similar to the 
early spectrum of SN1998S, showing very blue continuum, weak broad Balmer
lines and strong blended C III and N III lines 
(ATel #11816), probably, originated from circumstellar material ejected
by the star shortly before the explosion. 
SN2018cvn evolved dramatically and several days later shows a spectrum
similar to SN2004dj, a SN II without signs of 
ongoing ejecta-CSM interaction.

We report here on the photometric observations of the Type IIn supernova
SN 2018zd (otherwise known as  
Gaia18anr), discovered by Koichi Itagaki and classified by Zhang et al.

(ATel #11379), with the 60-cm Cassegrain reflector in Astronomical  
Observatory of the University of Wroclaw (Bialkow, Poland) over the  
period of 3 months (from April 14 2018 to July 15 2018).  
Observations took place during twelve photometric nights and data has been
collected  
in four bands of the Johnson-Cousins photometric system: B, V, Rc and 

Ic. I observed substantial and consistent decrease in brightness in all

four photometric bands, till the point where measurements became partly

unreliable due to the limitations of aforementioned telescope. We found

that Gaia measurements in G-band are more or less consistent with Rc band
measurements over long period of time. We also found that during two nights:
May 13, 2018 and May 19, 2018 a little  
increase in brightness may be spotted in all used photometric bands.  
Such an effect may be spotted also in the data taken from other nights.

Taking into account the precision of Gaia18anr photometry (especially 

during the first month of observations), we suggest it may be a photometric

manifestation of decay processes of radioactive elements.  

The follow-up photometric data are shown on Gaia alerts follow-up webpage
and can be requested from the author.

ATEL #12076,Infra-Red,"
We report fitting the SED of archival photometry of counterpart of MASTER
OT J155814.41-163017.1 (ATel # 12071) to the BT-NextGen set of model atmospheres
(Allard et al., 2009, Phil.Trans.Royal.Ast.Soc.A, 270, 2765). 

Measurements flagged as being of good quality are available from Pan-STARRS
and SDSS in the ugriz bandpasses.  Measurements in those two data sets
in comparable bandpasses are mostly within one sigma of each other. The
PAN-STARRS data and SDSS data were obtained at different epochs about five
years apart.  The ugriz magnitudes are all ~21. 

In the fitting, the object temperature was allowed to vary from 1000 K
to 70,000 K.  The Av was allowed to vary as an independent variable from
0.1 to 5.  Log g was varied from -0.5 to 6, and the metallicity was varied
from -4 to 0.5. 

The best fit when assuming no IR excess was obtained from the following
parameters: T = 50,000 +/- 968 K, Av = 1.57 +/- 0.30, log g = 2.5 +/- 0.5,
and metallicity z = 0.  A plot of the model fit and data is available at

http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/seppo/master_ot_j155814/master-ot-J155814.41-163017-sed.jpg

Our best fit Av assuming a standard Galactic extinction law corresponds
to E(B-V) ~ 0.40 to 0.60.  According to the three-dimensional Galactic
extinction map of Green et al. (2018; MNRAS, 478, 651), the E(B-V) in the
direction of MASTER OT J155814.41-163017.1 is ~0.25 for all distances from
~250 pc to 50,000 pc.   In addition, there is a slight flux excess relative
to the model SED in the i and z bands.  Thus the object may have a significant
amount of circumstellar extinction in the line of sight.  

If we assume for the fitting that the i and z magnitudes are affected by
some unspecified excess, the chi-square of the best fit improves from 9.6
to 5.2, and the new best fit is obtained with T = 50,000 +/- 933 K, Av
= 1.57 =/- 0.27, log g = 3.5 +/- 0.48, and metallicity = 2.5.

ATEL #12072,X-ray,"
The newly discovered X-ray transient Swift J1658.2-4242 (J1658) was first
detected in outburst by the BAT instrument aboard the Neil Gehrels Swift
observatory on February 16, 2018. Since then, Swift performed extensive
monitoring of this source from February through August of 2018 (ATel #11307,
ATel #11311). We used the online tools provided by the UK Swift Science
Data Centre (http://www.swift.ac.uk) to extract light curves and energy
spectra of all Swift/XRT available observations. 

Light curve created using the XRT observations of J1658 showed a peak of
the outburst on  02-03-2018 12:16:06 UT(MJD 58179.52)  (see https://sites.google.com/view/swiftj16582-4242).
To fit the spectrum extracted using the observation made on this date,
we began with an absorbed blackbody, however, we observed some residuals
indicating the presence of a high energy component. Adding a power law
component to the absorbed blackbody did not improve the fit. The broadband
observations made with NuSTAR and AstroSat showed the presence of high
energy cut-off  (ATel #11321, ATel #11375). Thereafter, we added a cut-off
power law to the absorbed blackbody for fitting the XRT spectrum.  As the
cut-off energy is much beyond the energy band of XRT, therefore, we fixed
the energy cut-off at 46 keV as observed with the AstroSat observation
(ATel #11375). We obtained an N(H) = 1.1(+/-0.3) x 10^{23} cm^{-2} and
a blackbody temperature of 1.22+/-0.03 keV. It was difficult to constrain
the power law index, therefore, we fixed the power law index to the value
obtained ~ 1.1. We obtained a Chi^2 = 753 for 652 degrees of freedom. All
uncertainties are stated at a 1-sigma confidence level. We also tried to
replace the blackbody component with the disk blackbody, however, we noticed
the increase in the  Chi^2 to 789 from 753  for 652 degrees of freedom.
Using the best-fit obtained with an absorbed blackbody plus cut-off power
law we estimated the absorbed flux to be 5 x 10^{-9} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}
in the 0.3-10 keV band. From the XRT light curve, we notice that after
this peak,  the flux of J1658 showed a gradual decrease. 

Swift/XRT observed J1658 for the last time on 10-08-2018 08:56:37 UT (MJD
58340.37). Due to the limited statistics, we could not use the Chi^2 statistics
but used W-statistics which is background subtracted Cash statistics. The
spectrum was well modelled with an absorbed power law of index 1.2 +/-
0.4 with an absorption fixed to NH= 1.8 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}. The  absorbed
flux measured in the 0.3-10 keV band using this observation is ~ 3.5 x
10^{-11} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. Given the flux trend, J1658 should be in quiescence.
To confirm that, we requested another observation of J1658 which was done
on 28-09-2018 02:50:54 UT (MJD 58389.1172, i.e. about a month after the
previous Swift/XRT observation). We detected only 2 counts in a 2000 s
long observation after background subtraction. We also determined upper
limits on the count rate (95 per cent confidence level) using the prescription
of Gehrels (1986). This turns out to be ~ 1.5e-3 c/s and using WEBPIMMS
we converted this count-rate into 0.3-10 keV flux. By assuming an absorbed
power law of index 1.5 and an absorption NH= 1.8 x 10^{23} cm^{-2} , we
estimated a flux of ~ 2.54 x 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. Assuming a source
distance of 8 kpc, this observed flux translates into a 0.3-10 keV luminosity
of  ~ 9 x 10^{32} erg s^{-1}. This is consistent with the quiescence luminosities
observed from these type of systems, and therefore conclude that the source
has transitioned into quiescence.

AT2018cow is a recently detected transient (Smartt et al. ATel #11727),
associated with a galaxy CGCG 137-068 at z = 0.014. Its physical nature
is debatable, with possible scenarios including the type Ic supernova (e.g.,
Xu et al. ATel#11740, Izzo et al. ATel#11753), an off-axis gamma-ray burst
afterglow (e.g., Rivera Sandoval & Maccarone ATel#11737), a tidal disruption
of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole, or a magnetar (e.g.,
Kuin et al. 2018 ; Perley et al. 2018 ; Prentice et al. 2018 ). To enable
the distinction between these models, we conducted the very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) observations of AT2018cow using the European VLBI
Network (EVN).  

The first-epoch 2-h pilot observation was carried out in real-time e-VLBI
mode at 1.67 GHz on 2018 September 18 (project code: RY007a) employing
the high-precision phase-referencing technique. The quasar J1619+2247 is
used as the phase-referencing calibrator. We detected an unresolved compact
source with a signal-to-noise ratio of 22. The accurate position of the
brightness peak is R.A.=16h16m00.2243s, Dec.=+22d16'04.893"" (J2000; formal
uncertainty ~1 mas), which is roughly in agreement with the position derived
from previous 22-GHz VLBA+Effelsberg observations on 2018 July 31 (R.A.
= 16h16m00.2242s, Dec.=+22d16'04.890: Bietenholz et al. ATel#11900). The
total flux density is 0.9 mJy (uncertainty about 10 percent) at 1.67 GHz,
more than double the reported 0.44 mJy from the latest Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope (GMRT) on 2018 Aug 12.71 UT in the 1390 MHz band (Nayana
& Chandra ATel#11950), indicating that the source brightness is increasing.
The increasing radio flux density suggests that the effect of synchrotron
self-absorption at centimeter wavelengths is decreasing.  

The follow-up disk-based experiment using the full EVN array, with better
(u,v) coverage and image quality, will be conducted on 20-21 October 2018
at C band (5 GHz). We expect to reduce the data and report the result in
a timely manner. 

The participant stations are : Effelsberg, Jodrell Bank, Medicina, Onsala,
Sardinia, Torun, Westerbork and three e-MERLIN stations (Cambridge, Defford,
Knockin). 

We thank the EVN PC for approving the trigger-of-opportunity observations,
and the staff of the EVN and the observatories for carrying out the experiment.

"
ATEL #12068,X-ray,"
We report on recent NICER observations of the transient black hole candidate
MAXI J1820+070 (ASASSN-18ey). 

After spending the initial part of its outburst in the hard state, MAXI
J1820+070 made a rapid transition to a softer spectral state in early July
(ATel #11820, #11823). NICER monitoring observations show that it remained
in this softer spectral state until recently. MAXI, Swift, and radio observations
(ATel #12057, #12061, #12064) indicate that the source started a transition
toward a harder spectral state between Sep. 21 and 23. Despite near-daily
NICER observations of the outburst, the start of this transition occurred
during a 4-day gap in our coverage. Swift observations revealed non-monotonic
spectral evolution, casting some doubt on whether the source was truly
returning to the hard state (ATel #12064). NICER light/hardness curves
and a hardness-intensity diagram (see link below) indicate that the source
is still continuing its rapid transition towards the hard state, but has
not yet reached the same hardness values seen during the initial hard state.

An energy spectrum obtained earlier today  (Sep. 28 12:41 UT, 120 s exposure)
can be well modelled with a combination of absorbed disk blackbody and
power-law components (similar to the Swift spectra analysed in ATel #12064).
We find an nH of ~2e21 cm^-2, a disk temperature ~0.22 keV, and a power-law
index of ~2.5. The 0.3-10 keV flux (unabsorbed) is 2.95e-8 erg/s/cm^2,
with a power-law flux contribution of ~65%. Compared to the Swift spectra
from Sep. 25, the disk temperature is lower and the power-law index higher.

In terms of X-ray variability, we observe significant evolution in the
rapid variability properties as well. The averaged 0.3-12 keV power spectrum
(PDS) from the last ten days before the current transition shows weak power-law
noise with an integrated (0.1-100 Hz) strength of ~0.5% rms. The PDS of
the first observation after the transition showed much stronger (~4% rms)
peaked noise around 2 Hz, with a hint of a weak QPO around 16 Hz. In the
days following the 0.1-100 Hz noise increased in strength to ~11% (Sep.
28) and decreased in frequency. Note that in the 2-10 keV band (which is
more comparable to the RXTE band) the rms values after the start of the
transition increased from ~11% to 27%. By Sep. 28 the QPO had decreased
in frequency to ~3 Hz and increased in strength as well. On Sep. 27, two
(probably harmonically related) QPOs were detected at 5.73+/-0.20 Hz and
10.78+/-0.13, with Q-values of ~5-6 and strengths of ~1.5% rms (~7% in
the 2-10 keV band). These are likely type-C QPOs. Combined with the position
of the source in the HID and the spectral parameters listed above, the
recent power spectral properties are consistent with the MAXI J1820+070
evolving through the hard-intermediate state. 

We strongly encourage rapid, simultaneous, multi-wavelength observations
of MAXI J1820+070 as it transitions. A file containing the upcoming NICER
schedule for the source can be found at the link below.

Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities

"
ATEL #12064,X-ray,"
The transient black hole candidate ASASSN-18ey/MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11820)
was discovered  in March 2019 by the MAXI mission when it entered the outburst
phase (ATel #11399, #11400). After an extended hard-state, the source rapidly
transitioned to the soft state on MJD 58300 (ATel #11820). 

Following the report of a rapid increase in the hard X-ray of MAXI J1820+070,
observed by MAXI/GSC and reported by the MAXI team (MAXI alerts and ATel
#12057), we triggered the AMI radio telescopes (ATel #12061) and Swift.

We report on the first of a series of observations, taken on September
25th (T01:45:57), and on two observations taken earlier, on September 17th
(17T21:23:57) and 22nd (T03:34:57), respectively.  
We extracted energy spectra in the 0.3-10 keV band from Swift/XRT data,
and we fitted them with a absorbed powerlaw + diskbb model. The resulting
best fits show a clear evolution of the spectral shape of the source. 

On September 17th the energy spectrum is well described by a multicolour
disk blackbody with inner disk temperature (0.603 +/- 0.004)keV and a weak
powerlaw tail (normalisation 0.3 +/- 0.1) with slope 1.7 +/- 0.3.  
On September 22nd the energy spectrum shows a disk blackbody with temperature
consistent with the above, but a harder (and slightly more prominent, normalisation
0.7 +/- 0.2) powerlaw tail, with slope 1.6 +/- 0.2.  
On September 25th the multicolour disk blackbody showed a lower temperature
of (0.481 +/- 0.008)keV and a stronger (normalisation 2.9 +/- 0.4) hard
tail, with slope 1.92 +/- 0.08. These parameters are consistent with those
reported in ATel #12057.  

The above shows that MAXI J1820+070 was still in the soft state on September
17th. However, we can refine the time of the transition to the hard-intermediate
state, which likely occurred on (or shortly before) September 22nd, consistent
with what reported by the MAXI team (ATel #12057), who found a spectral
change between September 21st and 23rd. We note that while the source has
clearly left the soft state, it might moving back and forth along the hard
intermediate, as the apparent non-monotonic evolution of the hard-tail
slope seems to indicate.  

Swift will continue monitoring this source and we encourage multi-wavelength
followup observations.  
We thank the Swift team for the prompt scheduling of these observations
(despite the inconvenient night trigger).

ATEL #12066,Radio,"
A rapid growth of the 6.67 GHz methanol maser in G107.298+5.639 was
observed during the night September 2/3 by Irbene 16 m radio telescope.
A day before the flux densities of two components at VLSR= -8.6 km/s and
VLSR= -7.38 km/s were around minimal detection level ~0.8 Jy. During 17
hours both components reached ~ 5 Jy peak flux density. Extensive monitoring
campaign (near continuous observation with 40 min intervals) have shown
that the current G107.298+5.639 flare is unusually strong: the -7.38 km/s
component reached 101 Jy peak flux density (2018 Sept 7, 21:05 UTC ) while
all previously reported values did not exceed 60 Jy, the -9.26 km/s component
reached 23.5 Jy and stayed close to this level from Sept 7 18:10 UTC 
till Sept 8 19:50 UTC, the -8.6 km/s component reached its maximum 11.5
Jy peak flux density on Sept 5, 21:45 UTC. Low intensity components also
flared: the -11.01 km/s component peaked with 4.5 Jy (Sept 8, 8:20 UTC),
the -15.4 km/s one peaked with 3.4 Jy (Sept 11, 21:20 UTC). The weakest
-16.6 km/s component peaked first (Sept 3, 17:00 UTC). 
According to our observations G107.298+5.639 flare maximums in September
and July are 66.4 days apart. This is less than expected from 34.4+/- 0.8
day period estimated by M. Szymczak et al. (2016). This can be a result
of the glitch or monotonous period change. If the source experiences monotonous
change of the period, the next methanol maser flare should be expected
earlier. 
The maximum of methanol maser was accompanied by the minimum of the
water maser emission. 
On August 23 water maser spectrum of the source contained 3 components
at -18.65, -16.5 and -14.6 km/s and these  flux densities were equal 240,
730 and 490 Jy respectively.  On September 6 only one component at -14.3
km/s had 165 Jy flux density. On September 26 all 3 components come back
and these flux densities are equal 240, 660 and 450 Jy respectively. Besides
that the component with 77 Jy appears at -9.9 km/s and the component with
40 Jy appears at -7.1 km/s. 
Observations at Caucassian Mountain Observatory of Moscow state University
have shown that in the period of the maximum of methanol emission brightness
of the object in K infrared colour was considerably increased.

The SUPERB project (Keane et al. 2018, MNRAS, 473, 116) detected a fast
radio burst (FRB) on UTC 2018-09-23-04:03:38.06 with the Parkes radio telescope
at 1.4 GHz. The FRB was detected in beam 01 of the 21-cm multi-beam receiver
(Staveley-Smith et al. 1996, PASA, 13, 243) centred at RA: 15:10:55.4 and
DEC: -14:06:10.2 with a positional uncertainty of approximately 14 arcminutes
(FWHM of the Parkes beam). It is not detected in any other beam. The burst
had a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) = 13 and a dispersion measure (DM) of
548(3) pc/cc which is a factor ~12 larger than the maximum dispersion measure
of the Milky Way along this line of sight, 46.6 pc/cc according to the
NE2001 electron density model (Cordes and Lazio 2002, astro-ph/0207156),
39.0 pc/cc according to the YMW16 electron density model (Yao et al 2017
ApJ, 835, 29). This translates to a maximum inferred redshift of z ~ 0.5
if the FRB lies along an average line of sight through the Universe (Ioka
2003 ApJ, 598, 79; Inoue 2004, MNRAS, 348, 999).  

FRB180923 is 20(1) ms wide and had a measured fluence and energy of 2.9(3)
Jy ms and ~4.5E32 J respectively. The pulse shows a frequency-dependent
scattering tail with a scattering time of 16(2) ms at 1.4 GHz. There are
no pulsars reported in the ATNF pulsar catalog within 7 degrees of the
burst position.  

The event occurred at a time of heightened radio frequency interference
(RFI) and, as such, we had to perform a longer than usual verification
analysis, in turn delaying the release of this alert with respect to our
usual targets. In this case the detection S/N was in fact 14, higher than
the optimised S/N once RFI had been excised. Immediately following the
detection we performed a calibration observation and continued to monitor
the field to search for any possible repetition. No repetition has been
observed. The linear polarization did not exceed the S/N threshold of 3
and no rotation measure could be recovered. We encourage follow-up with
other available facilities at different wavelengths and observing windows.

Two plots of the burst can be found at the link below.

The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports: 

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events arriving
from the position of AT2018gep/ZTF18abukavn (Ho et al. #12030) in the time
range of one day prior to the first detection to the 24th of September
(2018-09-08 04:00:00 UTC to 2018-09-24 14:00:00 UTC). Three neutrino track
events are found in spatial coincidence with AT2018gep during this time
period with a p-value of 0.038 (1.77 sigma) with respect to an atmospheric
neutrino background only hypothesis. Accordingly, these three events would
represent a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux normalization upper limit
assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE) at the 90% CL of 9.7 x 10^-5 TeV
cm^-2 for this observation period.  

The detected neutrinos, consistent with the source location within the
track uncertainties for these events (~2 degrees), arrived at: 

2018-09-11 20:48:33 UTC (MJD 58372.867) 

2018-09-19 17:19:50 UTC (MJD 58380.722) 

2018-09-21 23:52:16 UTC (MJD 58382.995) 

While these detected neutrinos do not represent a significant detection,
their arrival times are of potential interest to the astronomical community.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector
operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica. The IceCube realtime
alert point of contact can be reached at roc@icecube.wisc.edu.

ATEL #12061,Radio,"
The transient black hole candidate ASASSN-18ey/MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11820)
was discovered by MAXI in March 2019, when it entered the outburst phase
(Kawamura et al. ATel #11399, Denisenko et al. ATel. #11400). After an
extended hard-state, the source rapidly transitioned to the soft state
on MJD 58300 (Homan et al. ATel #11820). 

Following the report of a rapid increase in the hard X-ray of MAXI J1820+070,
observed by MAXI/GSC and reported by the MAXI team  (MAXI alerts and ATel
#12057), we triggered the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA).

We observed the position of MAXI J1820+070 at 15.5 GHz. Our observation
began on 24-Sept-2018/14:16:01.6 and had a total duration of 7 hours. We
used J1824+1044 and 3C 286 as the phase and absolute flux calibrator, respectively.
Data analysis was carried out as described in Bright et al. ATel #11420.

MAXI J1820+070 is clearly detected by AMI-LA, with an integrated flux of
910 +/- 70 uJy (uncertainties including the calibration error). The rms
noise of the image was ~30 uJy. 

We plan on continued monitoring of this source and would like to thank
the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory staff for carrying out these observations.

"
ATEL #12057,X-ray,"
We report on a rapid increase in the hard X-ray flux of the black hole
candidate MAXI J1820+070 in outburst (Kawamura et al. ATel #11399, Denisenko
et al. ATel. #11400). During the reflaring activity starting from around
2018 July 1 (MJD 58300), the source underwent a hard-to-soft transition
(Homan et al. ATel #11820). Since then, the source had been in the soft
state. MAXI/GSC data from 2018 September 22 (MJD 58383) show a significant
increase in hard (>4 keV) X-rays. Swift/BAT data also show that the 15-50
keV X-ray flux slightly increased on September 21, and dramatically changed
from 0.01 c/cm^2/sec to 0.04 c/cm^2/sec at the beginning of September 22
(https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/weak/MAXIJ1820p070/). These
suggest the source is undergoing a state transition. The count rates in
both MAXI/GSC and Swift/BAT, however, peaked on September 23, and decreased
again on September 24.

The GSC spectra obtained on September 20-21 (before the transition) and
on September 23 are well described by an absorbed disk blackbody (diskbb)
plus power-law model with a fixed column density nH of 1e21 atoms/cm^2
(Shidatsu et al., ApJ, submitted). The inner disk temperature, Tin, did
not change significantly from 0.53 +/- 0.01 keV to 0.53 +/- 0.02 keV, but
the diskbb normalization decreased 
from (2.8 +/- 0.4)e4 to (1.7 +/- 0.4)e4. On the other hand, the normalization
of the power-law component with a photon index fixed at 2.5  
increased by a factor of more than 3 (from 1.3+/-0.2 to 4.3 +/- 0.2). We
note that these parameters are provided only to show the change of the
overall spectral shape, and we do not intend to show a decrease of the
inner disk radius.

The unabsorbed 2-20 keV flux at the transition is (0.9-1.1)e-8 erg/cm^2/sec,
corresponding to the luminosity of ~1.2e37 erg/s if the source distance
of 3.2 kpc (Homan et al. ATel #11576; Gandhi et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11349)
and the isotropic radiation are assumed. As a result, the bolometric luminosity
at the transition is, for instance, below 1% of the Eddington luminosity
for a 10 solar mass black hole.

We encourage continuous multi-wavelength followup observations of this
bright and interesting X-ray nova.

We observed the field of AT2018gep/ZTF18abukavn (ATel #12030) with the
Very Large Array (VLA) on 2018-09-14 UT at a central frequency of 10 GHz.
The VLA was in D-configuration and the on-source integration time was 30
minutes. Data was processed using the VLA CASA Calibration Pipeline and
imaged using the CASA CLEAN function, using 3C286 as the flux calibrator
and J1640+3946 as the gain calibrator.  

We detect an unresolved source at the phase center. Fitting the source
using CASA gives an integrated flux density of 91 +/- 4 uJy at RA=16:43:48.177,
Dec=+41:02:42.97. With a synthesized beam major and minor FWHM of 12.4”
and 9.6” respectively, this position is consistent with the position
reported in ATel #12030. At z=0.033, the luminosity is 2E27 erg/s/Hz. We
caution however that this flux density is also consistent with the expected
radio luminosity of a star-forming galaxy, so we cannot rule out a host
galaxy origin at this time. 

We note that the FIRST catalog has a detection limit at this position of
0.94 mJy/beam, with a map RMS of 0.137 mJy/beam.  

Further follow-up is planned, and we would like to thank the VLA staff
for scheduling and carrying out these observations.

ATEL #12054,Infra-Red,"
In the framework of our EXor monitoring program dubbed EXORCISM (EXOR OptiCal
and  
Infrared Systematic Monitoring - Antoniucci et al. 2013 PPVI, Lorenzetti
et al. 2007  
ApJ 665, 1182; Lorenzetti et al. 2009 ApJ 693, 1056), we recently observed
V1647 Ori,  
an active low mass (0.8 Msun) eruptive variable in L1630 (D=400 pc), whose

classification as FUor or EXor is still unclear. This is the reason why
an accurate  
characterization of its outbursting/quiescence phases is in order. During
its recent  
history, V1647 Ori underwent three documented outbursts of about 5 mag
and 3 mag in the  
optical and IR bands, respectively. The 1st-one (detected on the Asiago
plates) on  
1966-67 (Aspin et al. 2006 AJ 132, 1298); the 2nd on 2004-06 (e.g. Acosta-Pulido

et al. 2007 AJ 133, 2020 and references therein); the 3rd on 2008-2011
(e.g. Aspin  
2011 AJ 142, 135 and references therein). These phases were followed by
quiescence 
phases (Ojha et al. 2006 MNRAS 368, 825; Aspin et al. 2008 AJ 135, 423).
In particular,  
a gradual fading has followed the last burst (Ninan et al. 2013, ApJ 778,
116). An  
absolute IR minimum was detected by 2MASS on 1998 Oct 7th. On 2018, Sept
3rd a deep minimum was  
registered by Semkov (ATEL #12012), who gives significant upper limits
(R and I bands)  
compatible with a minimum fainter than the first drop observed on 2008

(Mosoni et al. 2013 A&A 552, 62). 

During the current quiescent phase, we have observed V1647 Ori on 2018
Sept 10th 
in the J,H, and K bands with the NICS IR camera at the 3.6m TNG Italian
Telescope (La Palma,  
Canary Islands). Dithering was performed to cancel the nebular contribution.

The following values have been obtained: J = 13.68&plusmn;0.03, H = 11.88&plusmn;0.03,

and K = 9.73&plusmn;0.05. Given the short temporal distance between the
optical and IR  
recent observations (7 days), we could consider the R/I band upper limits
(ATEL #12012),  
as associated to the same phase. At variance with 
the behavior of the optical R and I bands, in the IR regime the source
appears 
brighter (specially in the J band) than what registered during the first
fading. 
This circumstance could be related to a rapid increase of the extinction,
or,  
more probably, to a brightening of the source occurred within few days.
Remarkably, this  
last interpretation puts strong constraints on the timescale of the source
fluctuations.

We report the photometry and the spectroscopy observations of the optical
transient AT2018gep discovered by the Zwicky Transient facility  (ZTF;
ATel # 12030).  The multi wavelength photometry observations were performed
with 0.6m GWAC_F60A telescope from 2018 Sep. 15th to 21th UT, at Xinglong
observatory, operated by the National Observatories of China and the Guangxi
University. The brightness is fading from 16.0 to 16.5 mag in R band during
the observation epoch, calibrated by the nearby USNO B1.0 sources ( RA=16:43:42.9,
DEC=41:02:40.9, R2mag=16.95).  

The spectrum was acquired on 11:15:10 UT, Sep. 21th, 2018 by OMR equipped
in the 2.16m telescope at Xinglong observatory. The wavelength range is
from 3500 to 8600 Ang. The spectral resolution is about 10Ang. The transient
shows a blue continuum associated with not only Ic-BL-like features around
4200 Ang and 5600 Ang, which is consistent with the report by (ATel #12047),
but also a likely bump due to the Ca triplet at the red end of the spectrum.

300 sec CCD frames taken with the 0.6/0.9m Schmidt telescope through BVRI
filters on 2018-09-18.94 UT (4.18 days after the initial burst in the observer
frame). 

The source is clearly present on multiple frames at R.A.=22:09:25.55, Decl.=+25:03:43.90

(Zheng & Filippenko, GCN 23236). Aperture photometry, tied to nearby PS1
stars, gives the following AB-magnitudes for the afterglow: 

B = 21.29 +/- 0.28, V = 20.78 +/- 0.19, R = 21.01 +/- 0.15, I = 20.30 +/-
0.18 

Compared to earlier optical detections (GCN 23236, 23237, 23238, 23239,
23240, 23241, 23243, 23244, 23245, 23246, 23249, 23250, 23251, 23252, 23253,
23255, 23256) the source is fading rapidly, in accord with the recent analysis
by Kahn et al. (GCN 23256).

ATEL #12046,Radio,"
The MeerKAT radio telescope has performed responsive mode observations
of the outbursting black hole transient H1743-322 (ATEL #12007) as part
of the ThunderKAT Large Survey Programme ( http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv171104132F).
A brief log of observations, including the number of antennas used in each
observation, is provide below. 

<br/> 
<br/> 

2018-09-05 17:12:05.4 0.82h 60 antennas 
<br/> 
2018-09-08 17:20:56.6 0.25h 59 antennas 

<br/> 
<br/> 

Observations on 2018 Sept 5th reveal a point source with a flux density
of 0.42 +/- 0.02 mJy at a central frequency of 1.284 GHz at the coordinates
of H1743-322. Observations on Sept 8th indicate an increase in flux density
at the same frequency to 1.0 +/- 0.04 mJy. These flux densities and their
evolution are rather typical of this source in outburst (e.g. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.414..677C).

<br/> 
<br/> 

Further observations are ongoing. 
<br/> 
<br/> 

ThunderKAT will run for 5 years and aims to monitor all bright, active,
southern hemisphere X-ray binaries in the radio band. For further information
on this programme please contact Rob Fender and/or Patrick Woudt.

ATEL #12047,Optical,"
We report the spectroscopic classification of two optical transients discovered
by the Zwicky Transient facility (ZTF; ATel #11266), AT2018gep and AT2018ggy.
<br/> 
<br /> 
The observations were performed with the 1.22m telescope of the Asiago
Astrophysical Observatory, operated by the University of Padova, in the
framework of the 2018 OPTICON Neon Observing School. The spectra were acquired
on 2018 Sep. 17 UT 19:10, range 3300-8000 Ang, dispersion 2.31 Ang/px.
The classification was done with GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A,
488, 383) and SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). <br/> 
<br /> 
AT2018gep is matched best to the Ic-BL SN 2006aj (Pian et al. 2006, Nature,
442, 1011) three or four days before maximum light. The redshift of the
source is 0.033, as derived by early spectrum (ATel #12030).<br/> 
<br /> 
AT2018ggy is an outburst of a symbiotic star. The spectrum shows a very
red continuum with narrow Balmer emissions at rest position. 

"
ATEL #12049,Optical,"
We report the redshift measurement of a recently discovered X-ray transient
in Chandra observations of the James Webb Space Telescope North Ecliptic
Pole Time Domain Field (JWST NEP-TDF) obtained in late July 2018. The location
of the X-ray flare (RA, Dec)=(17:24:21.72, +65:48:47.3) is consistent with
SDSS J172421.74+654847.5. The discovery of this X-ray flare was reported
in ATel #11906.  

A spectrum of SDSS J172421.74+654847.5 was obtained by D. Stern using
the Double Spectrograph (DBSP) on the Hale 200 inch Telescope at the Palomar
Observatory on UT 2018 August 11. Two 900 s observations of the target
were taken using the 1.5 arcsecs slit at the parallactic angle. The night
was not photometric due to a combination of ash produced by nearby fires
and high clouds. The data were processed using standard procedures and
flux calibrated with observations of the white dwarf spectro-photometric
standard star Wolf 1346 obtained on the same night. 

The spectrum quality is high enough to identify the following high signal
to noise ratio emission lines: broad (FWHM~5000 km/s) MgII 2799A, narrow
[OII] 3727A, and broad Hbeta 4861A. The redshift of the source measured
from these emission lines is z=0.833. The source luminosity in the X-ray
band is therefore Lx=1.4e^44 erg/s, assuming the flux measured from the
X-ray spectra reported in ATel #11906. From the observed optical emission
lines and the X-ray luminosity, we can confirm this source is an Active
Galactic Nucleus (AGN). 

We plan to obtain more spectra of this AGN to search for continuum variability.
A detailed analysis of the emission line profiles and widths, as well as
of the various absorption lines observed in the spectrum, will be presented
in future publication(s). 

We thank F. Harrison (PI of the Palomar night) and the (large) Palomar
crew on the night of this observations: post-PhD: Murray Brightman, Gael
Noirot and Joe Simon; Caltech Summer Undergraduate Research Fellows: Honghui

ATEL #12050,X-ray,"
Following the reports (ATel #11957, Sanna et al. 2018, arXiv:1808.10195)
that IGR J17591-2342 is an accreting millisecond pulsar in outburst, NICER
has continued to monitor this source. 

After the initial outburst, multiple instruments observed a re-brightening
that began on 2018 August 18 (MJD 58348; as reported in ATel #12004). During
that re-brightening, NICER observed the count rate to increase to about
3.8 mcrab (1-10 keV) around MJD 58362, then decline more quickly to about
2.3 mcrab by MJD 58367. Since then, the source has again re-brightened
to its highest flux yet, climbing to 5.4 mcrab as of MJD 58376.8 (see Figure
at link below for a 60-s binned light curve of the NICER data on this source).
The background contribution in this energy band is about 0.5 c/s.  Note
that in the 1-10 keV energy band, 1 mcrab corresponds to approximately
8 c/s in NICER. 

The pulsations remain strongly present after almost 60 days of outburst,
with a fractional RMS amplitude of approximately 7% (1-10 keV), in the
most recent data, so they have not disappeared as observed in some long
outburst AMXP systems, such as SAX J1748.9-2021 (Altamirano et al. 2008,
ApJL 674, 45) and HETE J1900.1-2455 (Galloway et al. 2007, ApJL 654, 73).
The 1.2-10 keV energy spectrum can be described by an absorbed power-law
model with a soft blackbody component. No evidence of a spectral state
change has been seen. We found a photon index varying between 0.9-2.1,
positively correlated with flux, across the NICER observations. At the
same time, blackbody temperatures ranging between 0.7-1 keV are seen. The
column density is 2-3E22 cm^-2, consistent with the values reported in
Sanna et al. (2018, arXiv:1808.10195).  

Continued multiwavelength observations of this ongoing transient are encouraged.
NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space
Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities
are funded by NASA.

The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) Bright Transient Survey
(BTS; ATel #11688) reports classifications of the following targets. Spectra
have been obtained with the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM)
(range 350-950nm, spectral resolution R~100) mounted on the Palomar 60-inch

were done with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). Redshifts
are derived from the broad SN features (two decimal points), and from narrow
SN features or host galaxy lines (three decimal points). Limits prior to
detection and current magnitudes are available on the Transient Name Server
(https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il). ZTF has reported 45 transient classifications

ATEL #12048,X-ray,"
During the observations in the direction of the Galactic Bulge (ATel #438)
carried out from 2018 September 18 at 11:55 to 15:36 (UTC), INTEGRAL detected
renewed activity from the transient neutron star low mass X-ray binary
(NS LMXB) SAX J1750.8-2900.  

The source is detected in the IBIS/ISGRI mosaic at a flux of 23+/-3 mCrab
in the 20-40 keV energy band and 29+/-4 mCrab in the 40-80 keV energy band.
The source is also detected by the JEM-X telescopes. The estimated fluxes
from the JEM-X mosaics are 20+/-3 mCrab in the 3-10 keV energy band and
16.0+/-9.5 mCrab in the 10-25 keV energy band.   

A preliminary analysis of the IBIS/ISGRI spectrum revealed that the hard
X-ray emission from the source could be characterized by a power-law model
with a photon index of 3.5+/-1.2 (90% c.l.). The measured 20-100 keV flux
from the spectral fit is 5E-10 erg/cm^2/s (no spectral analysis of the
JEM-X data has been carried out due to the calibration uncertainties affecting
the near-real time data).   

No type-I X-ray bursts were observed in the JEM-X lightcurves extracted
with a time resolution of 2 s in the 3-20 keV energy band.   

The most recent hard X-ray outburst from this source was announced in 2015
(ATel #8058).  

Further INTEGRAL observations toward the direction of the source are already
planned in the coming days. Multi-wavelength observations in other energy
domains are also encouraged, as well as observations to characterize the
source soft X-ray emission (< 3 keV).

ATEL #12037,Optical,"
Following the unprecedented optical outburst (ATel #12025) and the gamma-ray
flare detected by AGILE (ATel #12026) and Fermi LAT (ATel #12027) on 2018
September 9, a Swift target of opportunity observation of the flat spectrum
radio quasar B2 1633+38 (also known as 4C +38 41) was performed on September
13. 

Swift/XRT data were taken in Photon Counting mode for a net exposure of
about 1.9 ksec. The X-ray spectrum (0.3-10 keV) observed on 2018 September
13 can be fit by an absorbed power law model with an HI column density
consistent with the Galactic value in the direction of the source (n_H
= 1.1 x 10^20 cm^-2, Kalberla et al. 2005, A&A, 440, 775) and a photon
index of 1.41+/-0.14. The net count rate observed is 0.127+/-0.010 cnt/s,
corresponding to an observed 0.3-10 keV flux of (9.1+/-0.7) x10^-12 erg
cm^-2 s^-1.The count rate and flux observed indicate a relatively high
activity state in X-rays with respect e.g. to the Swift observations in
2009-2011 (Raiteri et al. 2012, A&A 545, A48). The hard photon index obtained
on 2018 September 13 confirms the harder-when-brighter behavior in X-rays
observed in 2011 during a previous gamma-ray flare of the source. 

Simultaneous Swift/UVOT observations were performed on 2018 September 13.
The measured magnitudes are: V = 16.29 +/- 0.10, B = 16.65 +/- 0.07, U
= 15.83 +/- 0.06, W1 = 16.10 +/- 0.08, M2 = 17.30 +/- 0.13, W2 = 17.69
+/- 0.13, in agreement with the optical magnitudes reported in ATel #12034,
and confirming the high activity state of the source in optical and UV.

In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source, confirmed also
by the Swift observations, we encourage further multiwavelength observations.
The Fermi LAT contact persons for this source are S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini
at ssdc.asi.it) and S. Buson (sara.buson at gmail.com). 

We would like to thank the Swift Team for making these observations possible,
in particular B. Sbarufatti as the Swift Observatory Duty Scientist.

The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) reports the discovery
of a tidal disruption event in a red star-forming galaxy (SDSSJ081526.63+453532.0)
at z=0.051.  ZTF18aahqkbt (AT2018bsi) is a nuclear (offset < 0.1 arcsec)
transient located at: 

08:15:26.62 +45:35:31.9 (J2000) 

123.860919 +45.592208 (J2000) 

The source was first detected by the ZTF Survey on UT 2018 April 09 with
r=18.19 +/- 0.03 mag.  We triggered the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine
(SEDM) (range 350-950nm, spectral resolution R~100) mounted on the Palomar
60-in (P60) telescope (Blagorodnova et al. 2018, PASP, 130, 5003) on UT
2018 April 18 which detected a blue continuum and a broad H and He II 4686
lines, which were confirmed with our follow-up R~1000 spectra with the
Discovery Channel Telescope DeVeny spectrograph on UT 2018 May 13.  We
triggered Swift observations taken on 2018 June 02 which detected an AB
magnitude of uvw2=17.90 +/- 0.05 mag, significantly brighter than the archival
AIS GALEX magnitude of NUV=19.22 mag (Bianchi et al. 2011). The source
then went behind the Sun.  We recently triggered a Swift observation taken
on UT 2018 Sep 05 that shows that the source has faded in the UV to uvw2
= 19.30 +/- 0.10 mag as expected for a UV transient.  The broad He II lines
and UV-bright nature of the transient are both consistent with the classification
of ZTF18aahqkbt as a tidal disruption event (nicknamed ZTF-JonSnow).  We
have triggered HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and XMM X-ray imaging observations
of the TDE to be observed between September 24th and October 5th.  Follow-up
spectra are encouraged.

Flat spectrum radio quasar 4C 38.41 (RA: 16h 35m 15.493s, Dec: +38d 08m
04.50s), also known as B2 1633+38, OS 356, 3EG J1635+3813, has recently
been observed to experience an optical outburst and also displayed multiwavelength
activity as reported by WEBT/GASP (ATel #12025), AGILE (ATel #12026), and
Fermi LAT (ATel #12027). Following these reports, we monitored the target
on September 11th, 2018 using the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT),
located at Hanle and operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics,
Bangalore.  

Data processing was done using concentric circular aperture photometry
technique to get the instrumental magnitudes of the source and the comparison
stars. Derived instrumental magnitudes were then calibrated using star
B of the finding chart from the webpage: https://www.lsw.uni-heidelberg.de/projects/extragalactic/charts/1633+382.html.
Preliminary analysis of the photometric data points indicates that on September
11, 2018, flux in B band was 16.48 +/- 0.005, V filter was 16.11 +/- 0.004
while in R band it was 15.66 +/- 0.005. Since the object is still in active
state further multifrequency observations of the source are encouraged.

The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) reports the discovery
of ZTF18abukavn (AT2018gep), a rapidly rising blue transient located at

16:43:48.22 +41:02:43.4 (J2000) 

250.950926 +41.045380 (J2000) 

The source was first discovered on 2018-09-09.17 (UT) at r=20.5 mag, and
rose 4 magnitudes in under 2 days. Early spectra obtained by D. A. Perley
with SPRAT on the Liverpool Telescope and by J. den Brok, N. Kamraj, M.
Koss, and D. Stern with DBSP on the 200-inch Hale telescope at Palomar
Observatory show a blue continuum with narrow galaxy emission lines at
z=0.033, making this a luminous transient (M = -19.7). The spectra show
a broad absorption feature around 5300 <span>&#8491;</span>. The rapid
rise, blue continuum, and luminosity are reminiscent of AT2018cow (ATel
#11727), but further observations are needed to clarify the comparison.
Notably, the broad feature seen in AT2018gep is redder and narrower than
that seen in AT2018cow.  

Swift has been triggered for UVOT and XRT imaging and further follow-up
observations are underway.

We report on UV/optical and X-ray observations of ZTF18abukavn/AT2018gep
(Ho et al., ATel #12030) with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Gehrels
et al. 2004). Observations started at 2018-09-09.59 UTC. We measured the
brightness of the transient using an aperture with a radius of 3'':

The magnitudes are reported in the AB system and are not corrected for
reddening. The reported measurements include flux from the host galaxy,
though we expect the total host contribution to be small based on GALEX
and SDSS observations obtained prior to the discovery of AT2018gep. 

Swift/XRT observations were carried out in photon-counting mode. We analyzed
the data using http://www.swift.ac.uk/user_objects/. No source was detected
at the position of AT2018gep. We infer a limit of 0.003 ct/s (3 sigma confidence).
Assuming a Galactic column density of n(H) ~ 1.1 E20 cm^-2, a redshift
of 0.033, and a power-law spectrum with photon index = 2, this count rate
corresponds to an unabsorbed flux limit of ~9.8 E-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in
the bandpass from 0.3-10 keV. At the distance of AT2018gep this corresponds
to a 0.3-10 keV luminosity L < 2.5e41 erg s^-1.

ATEL #12033,Optical,"
During the ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, <a
href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/%61bs/2014ApJ...788...48S"">Shappee et al.
2014</a>), using data from the quadruple 14-cm ""Brutus"" telescope in Haleakala,
Hawaii, and the quadruple 14-cm ""Leavitt"" telescope in Fort Davis, Texas,
we discovered a new transient source, most likely a supernova, in the galaxy
UGC 03912. 

ASASSN-18vc (AT 2018get)  was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-09-10.6
at V~16.5 mag. The source having only recently emerged from behind the
sun, our predetection limits offer minimal constraints.  We do not detect
(g>16.7) the object in images taken on UT 2018-05-05.1 and before. An image
obtained on 2018-09-11 confirms the discovery of the transient. This <a
href=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/assassin/followup/asassn-18vc.png>figure</a>
shows the archival DSS image of the host (left) and the confirmation image
(right). The red circle has a radius of 5"" and is centered on the position
of the transient in the confirmation image. 

The position of ASASSN-18vc is approximately 10.5"" North and 52.6"" West
from the center of the galaxy UGC 03912 (z=0.004086, d=19.7 Mpc, via NED),
giving an absolute V-band magnitude of approximately -15.1 (m-M=31.48,
A_V=0.147). Properties of the new source and photometry are summarized
in the tables below:

ATEL #12024,Neutrinos,"
Using data from the ANTARES detector, we have performed a follow-up analysis
of the recently reported single high-energy (EHE) neutrino IceCube-180908A
(GCN 23214). The reconstructed origin was 40.7 degrees below the horizon
for ANTARES. No up-going muon neutrino candidate events were recorded within
three degrees of the IceCube event coordinates during a +/- 1h time-window
centered on the IceCube event time. A search over an extended time window
of +/- 1 day has also yielded no detection (52% visibility probability).
This yields a preliminary 90% confidence level upper limit on the muon-neutrino
fluence from a point source of 18 GeV.cm^-2 over the energy range 2.4 TeV
- 2.6 PeV (the range corresponding to 5-95% of the detectable flux) for
an E^-2 power-law spectrum, and 36 GeV.cm^-2 (400 GeV - 250 TeV) for an
E^-2.5 spectrum.  

ANTARES is the largest neutrino detector installed in the Mediterranean
Sea, and is primarily sensitive to astrophysical neutrinos in the TeV-PeV
energy range. At 10 TeV, the median angular resolution for muon neutrinos
is below 0.5 degrees. In the range 1-100 TeV, ANTARES has a competitive
sensitivity to this position in the sky.

ATEL #12025,Optical,"
We perform  optical photometric and polarimetric monitoring of a sample
of gamma-bright blazars using  0.4-m LX-200 telescope (St.Petersburg) and
0.7-m AZT-8 telescope (Crimean Astrophysical Observatory), as a part of
WEBT/GASP project. We report that the blazar 1633+38 reached R=15.00 in
the night of 2018 September 9, TJD 58371.29. This is a brightest value
during the whole time interval of our observations since 2006. R band light
curve for <a href=""http://vo.astro.spbu.ru/optic/q1633R.png""/>1633+38</a>
can be seen on our web-page. The polarization degree is on the level of
15%. We mention that this fast brightening seems to have occurred with
a noticeable (~1 weak) delay after gamma-ray outburst reported by the AGILE
team (see ATel#12005). Current high activity state of this blazar deserves
close attention in all wavelengths. 

"
ATEL #12026,Gamma Ray,"
AGILE is detecting enhanced gamma-ray activity above 100 MeV from the blazar
4C +38.41 (FSRQ 1633+38), which follows the gamma-ray outburst reported
by AGILE (see ATel #12005). Integrating from 2018-09-08 UT 12:58:43 to
2018-09-10 UT 12:58:43, a preliminary multi-source likelihood analysis
detects a gamma-ray flux F(>100 MeV) = (3.3 +/- 0.9) x 10^-6 photons/cm^2/s
at a significance level of about 5.5 sigma. We notice that this gamma-ray
activity is occurring following the optical outburst reported by the WEBT/GASP
(see ATEL #12025). 

The AGILE-GRID detection was obtained while AGILE is observing in spinning
mode, surveying a large fraction of the sky each day. The source can be
monitored with the public mobile application ""AGILEScience"" developed by
the AGILE Team, available for both Android and iOS devices. 

Multifrequency observations of 4C +38.41 are strongly encouraged. 

"
ATEL #12027,Gamma Ray,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT),  onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope,
has observed an increasing gamma-ray flux from a source positionally coincident
with 4C +38.41 (RA: 16h 35m 15.493s, Dec. +38d 08m 04.50s (J2000); Johnston
et al. 1995, AJ, 110, 880). This is a flat spectrum radio quasar also known
as B2 1633+38, OS 356 and 3EG J1635+3813, with a redshift of 1.814 (Adelman-McCarthy
et al. 2008, ApJS, 175, 297).  

Preliminary analysis indicates that the source on September 9, 2018 was
in a high state with a gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (2.6 +/- 0.5) x 10^-6
photons/cm^2/s (statistical uncertainty only). During September 9, 2018,
the flux has increased by a factor of 9 over the average flux reported
in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL J1635.2+3809, Acero et al. 2015, ApJS,
218, 23). 

The source was in an active state during this day as reported by WEBT/GASP
(Larionov et al. ATel #12025) and AGILE (Cardillo et al. Atel #12026).
A flare from this source was reported previously by AGILE (Piano et al.
Atel #12005). 

The source is included in the list of publicly monitored sources: its preliminary
light curve can be found here: <a href=""https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/source/1633p382"">
https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/source/1633p382

</a> 

Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring
of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity
of this source we strongly encourage multiwavelength observations. 

The Fermi LAT contact persons are S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini at ssdc.asi.it)
and S. Buson (sara.buson at gmail.com).  

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan, and Sweden.

ATEL #12029,Infra-Red,"
We report SED fitting of catalog data to the progenitor of ASASSN-18uk
(AT 2018fxl) which was recently reported to be in outburst by Brimacombe
et al. (ATel # 12018).  The object has not been discussed in the literature
apart from catalogs.  Catalogs report magnitudes in U, B, V, Gaia G, R,
I, Y, J, Ks, Spitzer bandpasses at 3.6, 4.5, and 5.8 microns, and WISE
bandpasses at 3.35 and 4.6 microns along with WISE upper limits at 12 and
22 microns.

We fitted the SED from the catalog magnitudes to the BT-NextGen set of
stellar models (Allard et al. 2012, IAUS, 282, 235).  We allowed Av to
vary as a free parameter from 0.1 to 1, the temperature to vary from 800
K to 10,000 K, the log g to vary from -0.5 to 6, and the metallicity to
vary from -4 to 0.5. We also used the Gaia catalog estimated distance (~7200
+/- 1300 pc).

A good fit was obtained using a star having the following parameters: Teff
= 4150 +/- 150 K, Av = 0.195, log g = 0.5, and metallicity = -1.4 +/- 0.40.
It is seen that there is no infrared excess in the near-IR, while the
upper limits at longer wavelengths provide a weak limit on any strong IR
excess in that regime. The SED and model comparison plot is available at

Cloud. 

ASASSN-18uk (AT 2018fxl)  was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-09-08.41
at V~15.1 mag. We also detect the object in images obtained on UT 2018-09-07.31

object in images taken on UT 2018-08-29.33 and before, and the source has
not shown significant variability in past ~4 years of ASAS-SN data. An
image obtained on 2018-09-08 confirms the discovery of the transient. This

We conducted spectroscopic observations of AT 2018fsy (see <a href=""https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018fsy"">TNS</a>,
a nova candidate in M31, using the SPRAT instrument (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9147E..8HP"">Piascik
et al. 2014</a>) on the 2m-robotic Liverpool Telescope (LT; <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5489..679S"">Steele
et al. 2004</a>). Each spectral observation is preceded by a series of
(typically at least 3) 10s acquisition images taken either by SPRAT (unfiltered)
or <a href=""http://telescope.livjm.ac.uk/TelInst/Inst/IOO/"">IO:O</a> through
a Sloan-<it>r'</it> filter. This spectrum consisted of 3&times;600s of
exposure time using the blue-optimised mode of SPRAT. 

The spectrum of AT 2018fsy shows a blue continuum punctuated with Balmer
lines (H&alpha;-H&delta;), Na I-D, and possibly Fe II (42) and O I (7773&Aring;),
all of which show evidence of P Cygni profiles. The FWHM of the emission
portion of the H&alpha; line is 900&plusmn;200 km/s. The terminal velocity
of the absorption portion of the H&alpha; line may be as high as 2000 km/s.

The spectrum of AT 2018fsy is consistent with the early, post-fireball,
stage of a classical nova eruption within M31. Given the line widths and
the possible presence of Fe II lines, this is more likely an Fe II nova.

LT follow-up photometry of AT 2018fsy will commence. We will also attempt
to obtain a later time spectrum.

ATEL #12013,Gamma Ray,"
The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) collaboration reports the 
discovery of a new TeV gamma-ray source HAWC J0635+070. 
It was discovered in a search for extended sources covering 1128 days of
HAWC 
observations with a test statistic value of 27 (>5&sigma; pre-trials),
following the 
method presented in [Abeysekara et al. 2017, ApJ, 843, 40]. 
Its significance in the 2HWC data set excluded it from being included in
the 
catalog (~3.5&sigma; pre-trials), but with the addition of ~600 more days
of data it 
now satisfies that criterion. 
The best-fit J2000.0 equatorial position is RA=98.71&plusmn;0.20&deg;,
Dec=7.00&plusmn;0.22&deg;, with 
a Gaussian 1-sigma extent of 0.65&deg;&plusmn;0.18&deg;.

The spectral energy distribution is well-fit by a power law with spectral
index 
-2.15&plusmn;0.17. 
The differential flux at 10 TeV is (8.6 &plusmn; 3.2) &times; 10^-15 TeV-1
cm-2 s-1. 
All errors are statistical only; further morphological and spectral analysis
as 
well as studies of the systematic uncertainty are ongoing.

Given its spectrum and morphology, we believe HAWC J0635+070 may be the
TeV halo 
of the pulsar PSR J0633+0632 (Edot = 1.2e+35 erg s-1, dist = 1.35 kpc,

age = 59 kyr, unknown proper motion [Manchester et al., 2005, AJ, 129]).

The gamma-ray spectrum and morphology is compatible with a ""Geminga-like""
TeV 
Halo [Abeysekara et al. 2017, Science, 358, 911; Linden et al., 2017, PRD,
96, 103016]. 
We encourage follow-up observations at other wavelengths.

SN 2018anu was discovered by CRTS on 2018-03-29 (TNS Astronomical Transient
Report 
No.17554) at V=18.8. ATLAS detected the source on 2018-04-05 at o=18.5,
and it  
faded to ~19 mag before rising again over the past 80 days to 18.2 mag
(o-band).  

The transient was observed with SPRAT (Piascik et al. 2014) on the Liverpool
Telescope (Steele et al, 2004) on 2018-September 05.86 (UT). The spectrum
is similar to SNe II, showing a strong H alpha P-Cygni line with an expansion
velocity of -6500 km/s. 

SNID gives a best match to Type IIP SN 2005cs, 15 d past explosion at a
z=0.039. The SN is offset from the galaxy, GALEXASC J173615.16+185850.6.
A nearby galaxy (CGCG 112-011 NED02) has a NED spectroscopic redshift of
z=0.039120, consistent with that from the SN spectral fit and an offset
of ~30 kpc from the SN position, suggestive of a galaxy group environment.
Assuming this redshift gives a current absolute magnitude of -18.  

The potential multiple peaks and normal Type II SN spectrum are similar
to the behaviour of the unusual long-lived Type II SN, iPTF14hls (Arcavi
et al. 2017, Nature, 551, 210).

ATEL #12016,X-ray,"
We report an X-ray flare from the dMe star FT Psc on 2018 September 1 detected
with the MAXI/GSC.

The flare event was detected during a scan transit at 14:31 UT on 2018
September 1.  Assuming the source flux was constant over the transit, we
obtained the source position of (R.A., Dec) = (12.409 deg, 24.843 deg)
= (00 49 38, +24 50 34) (J2000) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical
error region with long and short radii of 0.31 deg and 0.26 deg, respectively.
The roll angle of long axis from the north direction was 43.0 deg counterclockwise.
There was an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment
radius). The X-ray flux averaged over the scan was 162 +/- 35 mCrab (4.0-10.0
keV, 1 sigma error). There was no significant excess flux in the previous
transit at 12:58 UT and in the next transit at 16:04 UT with an upper limit
of 20 mCrab for each. We conclude that this is the X-ray flare from the
dMe star FT Psc, since no other source in the ROSAT Bright Source Catalog
is located in the elliptical error region.

FT Psc is a single dMe star with a spectral type of M4 V (Gaidos et al.
2014). The rotation period and the distance are derived as 1.6968 day and
11.845 pc by Newton et al. (2017) and McDonald et al. (2017), respectively.
If we assume the distance of 11.845 pc, the above flux is corresponding
to 5e+31 erg/s in luminosity. 

We should note that the flare from FT Psc was also detected with the MAXI/GSC
during a scan transit at 23:44 UT on 2017 May 3, with no significant detection
in the previous and the next transit. With the same procedure and assumption,
we obtained the source position of (R.A., Dec) = (12.714 deg, 24.742 deg)
= (00 50 51, +24 44 31) (J2000) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical
error region with long and short radii of 0.41 deg and 0.34 deg, respectively.
The roll angle of long axis from the north direction was 14.0 deg counterclockwise.
There was also an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment
radius). With no other source in the ROSAT Bright Source Catalog in this
error region, we conclude that this flare was also from the dMe star FT
Psc. The X-ray flux averaged over the scan was 160 +/- 35 mCrab (4.0-10.0
keV, 1 sigma error), which is comparable to the newly detected flare on
2018 September 1.

ATEL #12009,X-ray,"
The MAXI/GSC nova alert system triggered on the flare-like event from the
position consistent with the RS CVn binary CF Tuc during a scan transit
at 07:24 UT on Sept 3 2018.  
Without assumptions on the source constancy, we obtain a rectangular error

box for the transient source with the following corners:

(R.A., Dec) = (12.498, -75.690) deg = (00 49 59, -75 41 23) (J2000)

(R.A., Dec) = (15.398, -75.527) deg = (01 01 35, -75 31 37) (J2000)

(R.A., Dec) = (13.924, -74.117) deg = (00 55 41, -74 07 01) (J2000)

(R.A., Dec) = (11.278, -74.281) deg = (00 45 06, -74 16 51) (J2000).

Since CF Tuc is the only known X-ray source in this error region, we concluded
that this is an X-ray flare from CF Tuc.  

The observed peak X-ray flux is 147+/-29 mCrab (1 sigma error) in the 2
- 20 keV band. The peak flux is about 2 times higher than the previous
flare detected by the MAXI/GSC at Jan 30 2012 (ATel #3897). Assuming a
distance of 89 pc and Crab-like spectrum, the peak luminosity is 4.6 +/-
0.3 x 10<sup>32</sup> erg/s.   The e-folding decay time of this flare is
about 9000 sec.

We obtained an optical spectrum (range 350-890 nm) of ASASSN-18tn/AT 2018fpb
on UT Sep. 4.7 2018 with the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope (LJT+YFOSC) at Lijiang
Observatory of Yunnan Observatories (YNAO). The spectrum is consistent
with a type IIb supernova at a few days before the maximum light. Cross-correlation
with a library of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification""
code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matches
with SN 1993J at t = -5 days from the maximum light. We noted that the
redshift inferred from the narrow H alpha emission presented in the SN
spectrum is about 0.0166, which is slightly larger than the estimation
of the host galaxy KUG 2357+340 reported in NED (i.e., 0.0148). This difference
might indicate an apparently large velocity distribution of the stars within
the host galaxy.

During the ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, <a
href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/%61bs/2014ApJ...788...48S"">Shappee et al.
2014</a>), using data from the quadruple 14-cm ""Paczynski"" telescope in
Cerro Tololo, Chile, we discovered a new transient source, most likely
a supernova, in the galaxy 2MASX J00403068-5041153. 

ASASSN-18ty (AT 2018fub)  was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-09-05.26
at g~17.3 mag. We do not detect (g>18.6) the object in images taken on
UT 2018-09-02.21 and before. An image obtained on 2018-09-05 confirms the
discovery of the transient. This <a href=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/assassin/followup/asassn-18ty.png>figure</a>
shows the archival DSS image of the host (left) and the confirmation image
(right). The red circle has a radius of 5"" and is centered on the position
of the transient in the confirmation image. 

The position of ASASSN-18ty is approximately 0.0"" North and 0.1"" East from
the center of the galaxy 2MASX J00403068-5041153. The transient lies within
the Camera 2 field of the ongoing <a href=""https://tess.mit.edu/observations/sector-2/"">TESS

ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient.

ATEL #12012,Optical,"
The PMS object V1647 Ori is located in the dark cloud Lynds 1630 - a region
of active star formation in the Orion B complex. The first outburst of
V1647 Ori was registered on 2004 by McNeil (McNeil, J. W., 2004, IAU Circ.,
8284) and it continues until the end of 2006. From the spring of 2006 to
the autumn of 2008, the star is at a very low level of brightness, with
no photometric data about it. A second outburst of V1647 Ori was registered
in 2008, when its brightness increased again to the level of the first
eruption (Kun 2008, IBVS, 5850). Our photometric data obtained during the
second outburst show that the star's brightness drops gradually by about
1 mad. (I-band) in the period from the end of 2008 to the beginning of
2018.  
Our observations were made with the telescopes of the National Astronomical
Observatory Rozhen (Bulgaria). We observed the position of V1647 Ori during
the night of September 3, 2018 with the 50/70 cm Schmidt telescope, and
during the night of September 4, 2018, with the 2-m RCC telescope at the
Rozhen Observatory. Our photometric data indicates that the star is below
the registration limit in I and R bands. Therefore, the star's brightness
is less than 19.5 mag. in I-band and less than 20 mag. in R-band respectively.
This means that we record a second dramatic drop in brightness, similar
to that observed in 2006-2008. Classification of V1647 Ori variability
remains questionable. Whether it is a FUor or an EXor or maybe an intermediate
object between the two classes.

During the ongoing observations of the Galactic center region with INTEGRAL
(in revolution 1995, MJD 58364.3-58365.3) we detected the known transient
black-hole system H1743-322/IGR J17464-321 to be at the initial stage of
a new X-ray outburst. 

We estimated the mean flux from the source during these observations to
be 42.3 +/- 1.4 mCrab and 52.6 +/- 3.6 mCrab in the 20-60 keV and 60-150
keV bands respectively comparing it with that from the Crab Nebula (observed
in revolution 1987). During the previous (public) observations of the region
(Galactic bulge monitoring, PI: Kuulkers) on MJD 58363.6 we have also detected
the source but at the marginal level of 21.1 +/- 3.0 mCrab (7 sigma) in
the 20-60 keV band. Given the spectral hardness of the source we can assume
that it is currently in the low (hard) state typical of the rising stage
of its X-ray outbursts. 

The previous outburst of this source was observed in the end of July 2017
(ATel #10599, #10751). 
Multi-wavelength observations of the source are strongly encouraged.

The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) Bright Transient Survey
(BTS; ATel #11688) reports classifications of the following targets. Spectra
have been obtained with the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM)
(range 350-950nm, spectral resolution R~100) mounted on the Palomar 60-inch
(P60) telescope (Blagorodnova et. al. 2018, PASP, 130, 5003). Classifications
were done with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). Redshifts
are derived from the broad SN features (two decimal points), and from narrow
SN features or host galaxy lines (three decimal points). Limits prior to
detection and current magnitudes are available on the Transient Name Server
(https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il). ZTF has reported 34 transient classifications

ATEL #12004,X-ray,"
We report on coordinated target-of-opportunity observations of AMXP IGR
J17591-2342 during its July/August/Sept 2018 outburst (see ATEL 
#11941, #11954, #11957, #11970, #11981, #11988, #12000) by INTEGRAL and
NuSTAR at hard X-rays/soft gamma-rays, accompanied by monitoring observations
at soft X-rays by the XRT aboard The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. 
The dedicated INTEGRAL ToO (PI. S. Tsygankov) observations have been performed
during Aug. 17 14:03:53 to Aug. 19 14:08:39, 2018 for an exposure time
of 163.1 ks (INT. ToO-I, INTEGRAL Revolution-1989) and Aug. 25 17:30:47
to Aug. 27 17:34:10 (INT. ToO-II, 163.1 ks, Rev-1992). 
The first INTEGRAL observation was coordinated with a 29.2 ks NuSTAR ToO
observation (NU-ToO-II; Observation id. 80301311002) taken about 4 days
later than a public NuSTAR ToO (exposure 27.1 ks; NU-ToO-I; Obs. id. 90401331002).
Swift monitored IGR J17591-2342 for 0.47 ks (Obs. id. 00010804004) and
3.94 ks (Obs. ids. 00010804006/7) during INT. ToO-I and INT. ToO-II, respectively.

Spectral analysis of the ISGRI 20-300 keV near-real time data of INT.
ToO-I adopting a power-law model yielded a 20-60 keV flux of 
9.1 +/- 0.7  mCrab and a photon index of 2.02 +/- 0.10. The second NuSTAR
ToO overlapping with INT. ToO-I showed a photon-index of 1.87 +/- 
0.01 and a 20-60 keV flux of 6.81 +/- 0.08 mCrab (combined Swift XRT /
NuSTAR fit), slightly lower, but consistent with the ISGRI flux, because
we observed an increasing count-rate trend during this second NuSTAR ToO,
contrary to the first NuSTAR observation which showed a decaying count
rate trend (20-60 keV flux: 15.7 +/- 0.08 mCrab; photon-index 1.84 +/-
0.01). 

Spectral analysis of INT. ToO-II 20-300 keV data yielded a 20-60 keV flux
of 18.2 +/- 0.7 mCrab, twice the flux as observed during the INT. ToO-I,
and a photon-index of 1.92 +/- 0.05. Moreover, the source is now significantly
detected up to ~150 keV in line with the assumed power-law model. Apparently,
a re-brightening already set in during the beginning of the first INTEGRAL
ToO on Aug. 18, 2018 (MJD 58348). 
Analysis of ISGRI data taken during (public) Galactic Bulge observations
(PI E. Kuulkers) of Rev-1994 and 1995 (end Sept. 2, 2018; 16:42:46) 
showed that the source is still bright with 20-60 keV fluxes in the range
25 - 38 mCrab (see http://www.sron.nl/~kuiper/ATEL/IGRJ17591-2342/  for
the preliminary outburst profile for the 20-60 keV band; NuSTAR data points
are indicated by filled squares). 

We also performed a timing analysis of the 20-300 keV ISGRI data of INTEGRAL
Revolutions 1989, 1992, 1994 (Gal. Bulge) and 1995 (Gal. Bulge) 
adopting the NICER timing model given in Table 1 of Sanna et al. (2018)
(arXiv:1808.10195). We clearly detected the 1.9 ms pulsed signal in the
20-150 keV band at 5.2 sigma confidence level with a profile shape similar
to that observed by NuSTAR during NU-TOO-I. 

Finally, we also searched the NuSTAR, INTEGRAL JEM-X (3-20 keV) and XRT
data streams for X-ray bursts from IGR J17591-2342, and found none. Because
of the peculiar outburst behaviour of the source with a re-brightening
onset at Aug. 18, 2018 we decided to apply for an XMM-Newton ToO, which
has been granted. Further low/high-energy observations of this enigmatic
source are strongly encouraged. 

We thank the INTEGRAL, NuSTAR and Swift teams for scheduling our ToO observations.

ATEL #12005,Gamma Ray,"
AGILE is detecting intense gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV from a source
at Galactic coordinates (l, b) = (61.23, 42.31) +/- 0.56 deg (stat.) +/-
0.10 deg (syst.), which is positionally consistent with the FSRQ 4C +38.41
(z = 1.81313).  Integrating from 2018-09-01 UT 09:00:00 to 2018-09-03 UT
09:00:00, a preliminary multi-source likelihood analysis detects a gamma-ray
flux F(>100 MeV) = (3.2 +/- 0.9) x 10^-6 photons/cm^2/s at a significance
level of about 6 sigma. The flux is consistent with the last reported gamma-ray
flare, observed by Fermi-LAT and AGILE on July 27, 2013 (ATel #5232, #5234).

The AGILE-GRID detection was obtained while AGILE is observing in spinning
mode, surveying a large fraction of the sky each day. The source can be
monitored with the public mobile application ""AGILEScience"" developed by
the AGILE Team, available for both Android and iOS devices.

ATEL #12000,X-ray,"
IGR J17591-2342 was discovered by INTEGRAL on August 11, 2018 (ATel #11941).
The outburst had actually started on July 22, 2018 (ATel #11981) and reached
its peak on July 25, with a flux  of ~50mCrab in the Swift/BAT energy range
(15-150 keV). Since then, the outburst smoothly decayed to lower flux values,
being detected at a flux of 3 mCrab by NICER (2-10 keV) on August 15th
(ATel #11957). 

During observations of the Galactic Bulge region between August 30, 21:10
and  August 31, 00:52 (UT), a significant rebrightening of the source has
been detected by IBIS/ISGRI. The flux estimated from the mosaic image is
~33 mCrab in the 20-40 keV energy range. The source is barely at the edge
of the JEMX field of view. We derive 3-sigma upper limits of ~20 mCrab
(3-10 keV) and ~40 mCrab (10-25 keV) in the JEM-X mosaics. 

The IBIS/ISGRI spectrum can be fit with a powerlaw model with spectral
index 2, showing no significant spectral variations when compared to the
IBIS/ISGRI spectrum of the system measured on August 11. 

INTEGRAL will be observing the region around this source until September
4th. We encourage observations at other wavelengths.

ATEL #11997,Ultra-Violet,"
Munari et al. (ATel #11937) reported that the emission line source HBHa
1704-05 is likely a symbiotic binary. The source is currently experiencing
a 'hot-type' outburst, since 2018 Aug 9 (ATel #11937). We requested follow-up
observations of the source using the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Our
observations were carried out ~19 days (on 28 Aug 2018) after the reported
start of the outburst. The AAVSO (https://www.aavso.org/lcg) and ASASSN
(https://asas-sn.osu.edu/) light curves of this source suggest that it
has maintained a similar optical brightness as reported during ATel #11937.

We obtained photometry in two UV bands using the Ultraviolet and Optical
Telescope (UVOT). The source was detected at 13.27&plusmn;0.05 mag in the
um2 band and at 13.20&plusmn;0.05 mag in the uw2 band. We also obtained
a UV spectrum (1650-5000 &#8491;) using the UVOT grism. Our spectrum shows
lines similar to those reported by Munari et al. (ATel #11937) in the overlapping
wavelength range. A full analysis of the spectrum is in progress. The UV
spectrum resembles that of the symbiotic binary CI Cyg (e.g., Mikolajewska
et al. 2003, Stencel et al. 1983). 

The source was also detected by the X-ray Telescope (XRT) at ~0.01 c/s
(0.5-10 keV). Unfortunately, the X-ray spectral shape of the source could
not be constrained as not enough photons were collected during the observation.
Assuming a power low model with an index of 2 and a column density of 2E21
cm<sup>-2</sup>, we obtained (using WebPIMMS) an unabsorbed flux of Fx~5E-13
erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (0.5-10 keV). Assuming that the source is at ~3.6
kpc (ATel #11937), the corresponding 0.5-10 keV luminosity is ~8E32 erg/s.

We thank the Swift team for scheduling our observations.

GK Per is currently undergoing a dwarf nova outburst (AAVSO <a href=""https://www.aavso.org/aavso-alert-notice-649"">Alert

<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1901ApJ....13..173H"">Hale 1901</a>).
We obtained a spectrum of the current outburst with the FRODOSpec spectrograph
(<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AN....333..101B"">Barnsley et
al. 2012</a>) on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5489..679S"">Steele

5900 to 8000 &Aring; and resolution of R ~ 5400, on 2018 Aug 29.17 UT.

The spectrum shows strong Balmer emission lines (H&alpha;, H&beta;, H&gamma;,
H&delta;, H&epsilon;). We measure the FWHM to be 540+/-30 km/s for H&alpha;,
540+/-30 km/s for H&beta; and 500+/-30 km/s for H&gamma;. The spectrum
also shows strong emission from He II 4686 &Aring;, which may be slightly
broader at FWHM = 610+/-30 km/s. These velocities are similar to those
seen during the 2015 outburst (ATel #7217). We see several He I lines,
including 4388, 4471, 4922, 5016, 6678, 7065 &Aring;. The highest S/N He
I lines (6678 and 7065) clearly show a double-peaked structure (evidence
for this can also be seen in the other He I lines), unlike the He II line,
which is relatively well described by a Gaussian profile. The Balmer lines
do not show a clear double peak, but they are somewhat asymmetric. We also
identify weaker features of OI (7773 &Aring;) and N III (4638 &Aring;).

African Large Telescope (SALT) using the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on
UT 2018-08-23.77 UT (JD 2458354.2701) employing the PG300 lines/mm grating.
A 600s exposure spectrum, covering 3400 - 9000 Angstroms at a resolution
of ~18 Angstroms with a 1.5 arcsec slit, was obtained in clear conditions.
The spectrum shows a very blue continuum with H I Balmer absorption lines,
with H-alpha filled in but not obvious emission reversal. H-beta has an
EW of 6.6 Angstrom and FWHM of 41.3 Angstrom. We interpret the spectrum
to be that of a Dwarf Nova in outburst. 

The spectrum is made available with TNS.

"
ATEL #11992,Infra-Red,"
We explored the archival images of the near-infrared (NIR) VVV survey (vvvsurvey.org;
Minniti et al. 2010, New Astron., 15, 433) of the Galactic Bulge and inner
disk, obtained with the 4.1m VISTA telescope at Cerro Paranal (Chile),
containing the soft X-ray error box the transient IGR J17503-2636 (ATel
#11952) that was recently detected with INTEGRAL.  

JHKs images were acquired on 2010 April 9 between 06:53 and 07:04 UT under
an average seeing of 0.9 arcsec. Further ZY photometry was collected on
2011 August 31 between 03:14 and 03:19 UT with a seeing of 1.0 arcsec.

Exposure times were 24 s in the J band, 8 s in both H and Ks, and 20 s
in both Z and Y bands; the image scale is 0.34 arcsec/pixel for all frames.

A single NIR object is present inside the 2.2 arcsec-radius Swift/XRT error
circle (ATel #11952) at the following coordinates (J2000):  

RA =   17:50:18.06

Dec = -26:36:16.7

(coordinate errors are +-0.1 arcsec at 1-sigma confidence level).

This position is 0.9 arcsecs from, thus formally outside, the corrected
0.7 arcsec-radius Chandra localization uncertainty of IGR J17503-2636 (ATels
#11990, #11991); however, the two positions are  
mutually consistent within the respective uncertainties at a confidence
level better than 1.5 sigma.

This NIR source has magnitudes  

Z > 19.9

Y = 17.90+-0.06

J = 14.23+-0.01

H = 11.79+-0.01

Ks= 10.65+-0.01

(confidence levels are 1-sigma for magnitude uncertainties and 3-sigma
for the upper limit). We point out that the shape information flag associated
with this object is ""-1"" (indicating a stellar source) in all the four
bands (YJHKs) in which it was detected. 

The source shows variability of ~1.2 mag across the 49 Ks frames available
for its field in the VVV survey over a time baseline of ~3.5 years, from
April 2010 to November 2013. It should be stressed that the object is close
to the saturation limit in the Ks-band and therefore the variability may

partly be due to spurious effects due to different saturation levels depending
on the sky conditions during each pointing; however, this issue alone cannot
account for the whole observed variation, which should thus mostly be intrinsic.

We moreover note that, according to Nishiyama (2009, ApJ, 696, 1407), the
Galactic Ks-band absorption along the line of sight of this source is ~2
mag, which implies an optical reddening A_V ~ 20 mag and explains why this
object is not detected at wavelengths shorter than the Y-band (indeed,
optical surveys such as the <a href=http://archive.eso.org/skycat/servers/usnoa>USNO-A2.0</a>
catalogue do not contain sources at the NIR position). 

All the above information is consistent with the NIR object being an heavily
reddened OB (super)giant star located beyond the Galactic Center, at ~10
kpc from Earth; this distance implies a peak X-ray luminosity of ~2e36
erg/s according to the data reported in ATel #11952. We thus suggest that
this source is the NIR counterpart of IGR J17503-2636 and that this object
is a high-mass X-ray  
binary, possibly of the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient subclass given
its X-ray luminosity at maximum brightness and the rapid decay of its X-ray
emission as reported from the Chandra observations (ATel #11990).

"
ATEL #11991,X-ray,"
In ATEL #11990, the uncertainty radius for the source position is quoted
incorrectly as 1.1 arcsec.  The correct uncertainty radius is 0.7 arcsec,
from a statistical uncertainty of 0.3 arcsec and a systematic uncertainty
of 0.6 arcsec. 

"
ATEL #11988,X-ray,"
Starting on 2018 Aug 23 at 17:53 UTC, Chandra performed a 20 ksec follow
up observation of IGR J15791-2342 (see ATELs 11941, 11942, 11946 11954,
11957, 11970, 11981, and 11985) using the High Energy Transmission Grating
Spectrometer (HETGS).  

The Chandra position, determined from intersecting the dispersed spectra
of the High Energy Gratings (HEG) and Medium Energy Gratings (MEG) is (J2000)
RA = 17:59:02.83, Dec = -23:43:0.8.0.   This position is within 0.6 arcsec
of that reported from VLT observations of an IR counterpart (ATel 11970)
and within 0.5 arcsec of that reported from ATCA observations of a radio
counterpart (ATel 11954). Without any other sources within the Chandra
field of view to further refine the astrometry, these small differences
are consistent with typical Chandra astrometric uncertainties. 

The source remains bright with a 1-9 keV flux of (1.56+/-0.03) x 10^-10
erg/cm^2/s (90% confidence level, not corrected for absorption), with minimal
long time scale variability over the course of this observation.  Preliminary
fits indicate that the X-ray spectra of IGR J15791-2342 are well-described
by an absorbed power law with photon index of 1.80+/-0.06 (90% confidence
level) and NH column of (4.9 +/-0.2) x 10^22 cm^-2, where we have modeled
the absorption with the prescription (including abundances) of Wilms, Allen,
& McCray (2000, ApJ, 542, 914).   

The measurement of the absorption column density is partly driven by detection
of a Si edge; however, further work is required to assess what fraction
of the absorption is local to the system and what fraction is attributable
to the interstellar medium.  There is some evidence for further high resolution
structure within the HETGS spectra. 

As the source remains bright, additional multi-wavelength observations
are encouraged.

telescope we have detected the bright flare from the well known X-ray binary
SS433.  On 25 August (MJD 58355.76) the flux at 2.3 GHz reached a level
of 3.2 Jy and the total spectrum is well fitted by the power law: S_nu[Jy]=6.4nu^(-0.81)[GHz]
at frequencies higher 2.3 GHz, almost the same spectrum as we have detected
in October 2012 (ATel #4484). In the light curves of   
<A HREF=""https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/SS433/"">  Swift/BAT
</A>  and   
<a HREF =""http://maxi.riken.jp/star_data/J1911+049/J1911+049.html""> MAXI
</a>   
we can see the  obvious signs of activity.  It is interesting that during
last 70 days there were three powerful flaring events in SS433 (the link
on the RATAN light curves are given in ATel #11870).  Second one consisted
of two radio peaks, first one was associated  with the bright optical outburst
by Goranskij et al. (ATel #11870), the second radio peak was observed in
follow-up observations with Swift/XRT by Khabibullin et al. (ATel #11975).
We continue observations, possibly SS433 will brighten, additional multi-wavelength
observations are encouraged.

ATEL #11990,X-ray,"
As part of an ongoing Chandra X-ray Observatory program for the precise
localization of X-ray transients in low-mass X-ray binaries, we obtained
a short Chandra/HRC-S observation of IGR J17503-2636, following reports
of its 2018 August outburst (ATEL #11952).  Our observation was made in
TIMING mode on 2018 August 23, 23:31 TT (MJD 58353.98), which was 12 days
after the  outburst was first detected by INTEGRAL. The exposure livetime
was 1016.6 s. 

The X-ray source had faded considerably by the time of our observation,
yielding only a weak detection. We observed 11 counts within the 2.2 arcsec
Swift error circle (ATEL #11952), compared to an expected background of
1 count.  All 11 counts fell within a 1.8 arcsec radius of their mean position,
and 6 counts fell within 0.5 arcsec radius of this position. Given the
background count rate of 0.068 count/arcsec^2, the chance probability of
detecting at least 11 counts within a 2.2 arcsec radius is 1.2e-8, corresponding
to an equivalent Gaussian significance of 5.7 sigma.  The chance probability
of detecting at least 6 counts within a 0.5 arcsec radius is 3.0e-11, corresponding
to an equivalent Gaussian significance of 6.6 sigma.  We associate the
6 closely clustered counts with the core of the Chandra point-spread function
(PSF).  The mean sky position for these 6 counts is  

RA(J2000) = 17h 50m 17.99s 

Dec(J2000) = -26d 36' 16.7"" 

with an uncertainty radius of 1.1 arcsec (from a statistical uncertainty
of 0.9 arcsec and a systematic uncertainty of 0.6 arcsec).  This is consistent
with the Swift X-ray error circle (ATEL #11952, 2.2 arcsec radius), lying
1.0 arcsec from its center.  

The arrival times of the 11 events showed evidence for variability or flaring.
In particular, we observed 2 events in the PSF core within a 
3-second interval with a spatial separation of 0.16 arcsec, part of a cluster
of 5 events (from the entire sample) observed within a 
1-minute interval.  Associating all 11 counts with the source region, the
background-subtracted mean count rate was 0.010(3) count/s. 
The spectral shape in the HRC-S band is not well determined but is highly
absorbed (ATEL #11952).  Assuming an absorbed power-law X-ray spectrum
with photon index gamma=2.0 and absorption column N_H = 1e23 cm^(-2), our
count rate corresponds to an absorbed X-ray flux of 2.9e-12 erg/cm^2/s
in the 0.2-10 keV band.

We report on the recent brightening of the AGN candidate MASTER OTJ013135.43+555831.5.
On August 6th,2018 MJD(2458336.986), The source had NIR fluxes corresponding
to J = 14.665 +/- 0.05, H = 13.397 +/- 0.05 and Ks = 12.384 +/- 0.05. While
on MJD 2458116.708 the flux in the H band corresponded to H = 16.005 +/-
0.04. Hence, the source increased its flux by a factor of 11 in this lapse.
This fact and its NIR colors render further support to the observed NIR
colors render support to the idea that it is an AGN. Spectroscopic data
is highly desirable. Our observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope
of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated by the National Institute for
Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument
CANICA a NIR camera. We encourage further multiwavelength coverage.

The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) reports the discovery
and classification of SN2018fcg (ZTF18abmasep) as a SLSN-I. The source
was first discovered on 2018 Aug 07.37 (UT) at g=20.6 mag. A spectrum obtained
with DBSP on the 200-in Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory on 2018 Aug
21 as part of the ZTF Bright Transients Survey (BTS; ATel #11688) shows
a blue continuum with broad O II absorption features, similar to SLSN-I
PTF09cnd and PTF09atu prior to maximum light (Quimby et al. 2011). Narrow
emission lines from the host galaxy give a redshift of z=0.101. As of 2018
Aug 22.36, SN2018fcg has brightened to g=18.5 mag, giving a current absolute
magnitude Mg=-19.7 mag and suggesting that the source could still brighten
significantly before reaching maximum light. Swift has been triggered for
UVOT imaging and further follow-up observations are underway.

The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) Bright Transient Survey
(BTS; ATel #11688) reports classifications of the following targets. Spectra
have been obtained with the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM)
(range 350-950nm, spectral resolution R~100) mounted on the Palomar 60-inch
(P60) telescope (Blagorodnova et. al. 2018, PASP, 130, 5003). Classifications
were done with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). Redshifts
are derived from the broad SN features (two decimal points), and from narrow
SN features or host galaxy lines (three decimal points). Limits prior to
detection and current magnitudes are available on the Transient Name Server
(https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il). ZTF has reported 24 transient classifications

The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) Infant Supernova Science
Program reports the early discovery and rapid follow-up of SN 2018fif (ZTF18abokyfk).

The object was first detected on ZTF r-band images obtained on August 21,
2018 at 8:46 UT, about 23 hours after the last non-detection, and was picked
up by the infant supernova custom Marshal filter. The object was saved
by a duty astronomer and rapid follow-up was triggered. A spectrum obtained
with the 5m Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory on 12:08 UT showed a
smooth blue continuum with a weak flash feature of He II, suggesting this
is a very young core-collapse event, at the redshift of the apparent host
(UGC 85, z=0.017189 from NED). Swift photometry obtained starting 13:40
UT shows clear detection in all UVOT filters. Radio follow-up conducted
using AMI several hours later resulted in a non-detection, with a flux
upper limit of 0.4 mJy. Additional observations are ongoing.

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient.

ATEL #11980,Optical,"
We obtained SALT (+RSS) spectroscopy of ASASSN-18tb (= SN 2018fhw; ATel
#11976) on 2018 August 23.3 UT, covering the wavelength range 350-940 nm.
Cross-correlation of the supernova spectrum with a template library using
SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows a good match to the type-Ia
SN 2003iv at +1 day after maximum light. We also placed the longslit through
the nucleus of the host galaxy 2MASX J04180598-6336523 and derive a heliocentric
redshift of 5090 +/- 30 km/s using cross-correlation with galaxy templates.
The expansion velocity of the supernova (measured to the trough of the
Si II rest 635.5 nm line) is approximately 9,980 km/s. Given the location
of ASASSN-18tb in the TESS Sector 1 field, continued follow-up observations
of this supernova are encouraged.

(MJD 58320-58349), starting 20 days before the INTEGRAL discovery.    The
count rate was 0.0067 +/- 0.0013 ct/cm2/s (~30 mCrab; MJD 58320), peaked
at 0.011 +/ 0.0014 ct/cm2/s (~50 mCrab; MJD 58324) and was detected at
0.0040 +/- 0.0009 ct/cm2/s (~18 mCrab; MJD 58340 = 2018-Aug-10, the date
of the INTEGRAL discovery) and at 0.0048 +/- 0.0011 ct/cm2/s (~22 mCrab;
MJD 58349).   The peak rate and duration are roughly consistent with those
of the accreting millisecond pulsar, Swift J1756.9-2508 (Krimm et al, ApJL
668, 147, 2007; ATel #11497; ATel #2129). 

The source was not in the INTEGRAL field of view for the ~20 days prior
to the INTEGRAL detection on MJD 58340, except for MJD 58334, when it was
at the edge of the ISGRI field of view, and thus not detected.

ATEL #11975,X-ray,"
We present results of the Swift observation of SS 433 performed in follow-up
of a bright optical outburst reported in ATel#11870.  

The observation started at 2018-07-25 07:19:01T (MJD=58324.30567, ObsID
00035190036), i.e. 7.534d after the outburst. The observation consisted
of two segments separated by 0.397d (34.3ks). Total exposure time with
the Swift/XRT for two segments equals 1030.5s collected in Photon Counting
mode, 353.5s for the first segment and 677s for the second one. The UVOT
accumulated image in U-filter during the single exposure with 350s duration
started 87s after the beginning of the first XRT segment. 

The light curve and spectra were extracted from the 50'' circular aperture,
the background was extracted from the annulus surrounding the source with
96'' inner radius and 480'' outer radius. Data reduction and processing
have been performed using the standard Swift routines (XRTDAS) and XSELECT
tool of the heasoft package (v6.24) and most recent calibration data. 

The source has been detected in 0.3-10 keV band by XRT and in U band by
UVOT with the mean background-corrected count rates 0.48&plusmn;0.02 cts/s
and 3.01&plusmn;0.16 cts/s, respectively. The latter corresponds to the
flux density F<sub>&lambda;</sub>=4.8&plusmn;0.24 erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>
/&#8491;=180&plusmn;1  &micro;Jy (17.51 Vega magnitude) in the U band,
consistent with previous Swift observations of Dolan et al. 2007 and ATel#6364.

The 0.5-10 keV light curve shows significant variation between the two
segments, with the first one being on average a factor of 1.5 brighter
then the second one. There is no significant variation in relative contributions
of narrower bands, which indicates absence of strong variation in the absorbing
column density or relative contribution of the jets and the hard (cold
reflection) component (see Khabibullin et al. 2016). The only exception
might be a significant increase in [6-10] keV count rate during the second
segment of the observation. This conclusion is confirmed by analysis of
the spectra extracted from the full observation and individual segments.

We fit the spectra with with a model consisting of bremsstrahlung continuum
and line emission from the pair of baryonic relativistic jets (as described
in Medvedev et al. 2018). The spectral shape of all three datasets appeared
to be consistent with the latest XMM-Newton observation, but with the overall
normalization 0.23&plusmn;0.03, N<sub>H</sub>=1.25&plusmn;0.15&times;10<sup>22</sup>
cm<sup>-2</sup>, and redshift of the blue jet z<sub>b</sub>=-0.034&plusmn;0.026
(redshift of the other jet is not constrained). This is consistent with
the expectation for the SS 433's precession phase at the moment of the
observation (0.22).  

Importantly, fitting of the spectrum with simpler models (e.g. absorbed
powerlaw or bremsstrahlung) results in significantly lower values of N<sub>H</sub>
because of the dominant contribution of jets spectral line emission below
2 keV. The bremsstrahlung continuum has temperature 30 keV and unabsorbed
0.5-10 keV flux 4.0&times;10<sup>-11</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>-2</sup>. The jets
line emission gives unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux at level 2.6&times;10<sup>-11</sup>
erg/s/cm<sup>-2</sup> (1.8&times;10<sup>-11</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>-2</sup>
below 2 keV).  

The detected X-ray emission corresponds to the class of SS 433's low X-ray
states, which are 3-5 times dimmer then the more common normal out-of-eclipse
states (Marshall et al. 2013). This is illustrated by comparison of the
current observation with Chandra/HETGS data of another low-state spectrum
(ObsID 1020). The latter indeed has similar overall intensity, however,
with a slight excess at low energies.  

Noteworthy, according to the RATAN-600 radio light curve, SS 433 experienced
another bright radio outburst at the moment of the X-ray observation reported
here.  

We are grateful for Swift team for rapid scheduling of our observations.

ATEL #11976,Optical,"
During the ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, <a
href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/%61bs/2013arXiv1310.2241S"">Shappee et al.
2014</a>), using data from the quadruple 14-cm ""Cassius"" telescope in Cerro
Tololo, Chile, we discovered a new transient source, most likely a supernova,
in the galaxy 2MASX J04180598-6336523. 

ASASSN-18tb (AT 2018fhw)  was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-08-21.31
at V~16.8 mag. We do not detect (V>17.9) the object in images taken on
2018-08-15.40 and before. A follow-up image obtained on 2018-08-21 confirms
the discovery of the transient. This <a href=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/assassin/followup/asassn-18tb.png>figure</a>
shows the archival DSS image of the host (left) and the confirmation image
(right). The red circle has a radius of 5"" and is centered on the position
of the transient in the confirmation image. 

The position of ASASSN-18tb is approximately 4.8"" South and 1.9"" East from
the center of the galaxy 2MASX J04180598-6336523. The transient lies within
the Camera 4 field of the ongoing <a href=""https://tess.mit.edu/pointing/"">TESS

are summarized in the tables below:

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient. 

We thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their continued support
of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
through grant GBMF5490 to the Ohio State University, NSF grant AST-1515927,

ATEL #11971,Infra-Red,"
The bright transient ASASSN-18su (g~10) reported by Stanek et al. (ASAS-SN,
Atel #11968) was classified as CV by Callis et al. (ePESSTO, Atel #11969)
without identification of the probable progenitor.  

The object is almost coincident (1.5 arcsec) with the position of an object
listed in Gaia Data Release 2 (GDR2; Gaia Collaboration 2018 A+A in press,
arXiv:1804.09365) as source 6185371175372936064, with magnitude G=17.90.
The source has a relatively large parallax of 5.52 +/- 0.15 mas (181 +/-
5 pc without systematic correction), and large proper motion.  

SkyMapper DR1 images (Wolf et al. 2018, PASA, 2018, 35, 10) available through
Aladin Sky Atlas (Bonnarel et al. 2000, A+AS, 143, 33) shows a very faint
object with interesting features: the R-band image is elongated, while
the I-band image is also elongated but perpendicular to and centered in
the R-band elongation. This structure could be indication of a bipolar
nebula or outflow, due to a probable H-alpha emission contribution to the
R-band. Furthermore, the source is detected particularly bright in GALEX,
faint in WISE/W1/W2, and detectable in 2MASS (but shifted due to proper
motion). Gaia DR2, GALEX and other survey images support that ASASSN-18su
is a CV as reported in Atel #11969, but also this is a nearby CV with probable
ejected material (as suggested by SkyMapper images).

(1) Spectrum of transient appears blue and featureless, aside from narrow
lines likely associated with the host.

(2) Discovered also by ATLAS as ATLAS18tvh.

(3) Best matching templates are 91T-like.

(4) ATLAS18tec was observed as part of the GREAT survey (Chen et al. 2018arXiv180804382C).
It had a black body temperature of T_BB ~ 12700 +/- 500 K, obtained from
photometry taken on 15.08.2018 with g=17.94, r=18.11, i=18.31, z=18.41
mag, calibrated against SDSS field stars. The spectrum matches that of
PTF12dam around peak, implying an absolute magnitude of ~ -22.

ATEL #11970,Infra-Red,"
We report on near-infrared (NIR) follow-up of the new accreting millisecond
X-ray pulsar IGR J17591-2342, discovered by INTEGRAL and localized by Swift
and ATCA (ATel #11941, #11942, #11954).  

We obtained imaging in the Ks and H bands, using the High Acuity Wide-field
K-Band Imager (HAWK-I) mounted on UT4 of the Very Large Telescope on Cerro
Paranal, Chile. Conditions were excellent, with seeing <1"". We obtained
7 exposures of 195s in Ks, with each co-added exposure consisting of 13
dithered 15s exposures. In H we obtained 7 exposures of 65s, with each
co-add consisting of 13 dithered 5s exposures. Data were reduced with ESO's
reflex pipeline and we extract photometry from the pipeline products. 

We detect a source at RA (J2000) =17:59:02.87, Dec (J2000) = -23:43:08.2,
with magnitudes of H=19.56 +/- 0.07 and Ks=18.37 +/- 0.07. The source position
is completely consistent with the ATCA position reported by Russell et.
al. (ATel #11954) and the typical astrometric uncertainty in the HAWK-I
images is ~0.03"". We therefore propose that this is the NIR counterpart
of the pulsar. 

Though the counterpart is faint, follow-up observations are encouraged,
particularly NIR spectroscopy.

ATEL #11966,Optical,"
V442 And (= HD6226) has been monitored as part of an ongoing effort to
understand its activity cycles.  Since Jun. 2018 the star has been under
scrutiny in an attempt to detect the initiation of an outburst.  This Be
star has undergone several spectroscopically active intervals in the past
few years.  Equipment used is a T0.28m telescope with R=10000 echelle spectrograph,
Atik 460ex CCD camera, PRISM v10 software for acquisition and ISIS v5.8.0
for spectra reduction. 

No substantial spectral changes were detected between Jun 27.089 and Aug
11.009 (33 spectra).  However, the Halpha line showed a very significant
increase in emission on Aug 14.997 (exposure time of 4800 sec, S/N > 50).
Halpha line has shown drastic V/R changes every night since then.   
Emission was not visible on Hbeta line on Aug 14.997 spectrum but was detected
in emission with a 6000 sec spectrum taken on Aug t 15.966 as a single
emission on the blueward of the absorption line. The Aug 15.966 spectrum
is also showing a broad, weak blueshifted emission on Hgamma. 

Further spectroscopic observations are strongly encouraged, especially
across a broad wavelength range and at high resolution.  Spectra are available
at the BeSS Be Star Spectra database and further spectra submitted there
as well.

(1) AT2018fes appeared to be located 2"" from the centre of NGC 7421 in
ATLAS difference images. No source was visible on an EFOSC2 acquisition
image, and a spectrum centered on the host nucleus appears to contain only
galaxy light.

(2) Weak, narrow Halpha emission on a blue continuum.

(3) Best matches are to SN 1991T.

(4) Spectrum is very blue, but with weak broad Balmer lines consistent
with a young Type II SN.

(5) Previously classified in ATel #11965. The spectrum taken on Aug 17
is less blue than the spectrum taken on the preceding night, as expected
for a very young SN. In ATel #11965 the wavelengths of the weak emission
features seen in the Aug 16 spectrum were incorrectly reported. The first
weak feature is actually at ~4945 Ang, possibly on top of a broader (~100
Ang) bump. A second weak feature is at ~4390 Ang. The first weak feature
may be associated with a blend of He and high-ionization C/N lines often
seen in very young SNe, implying a redshift of z=0.05.

(6) Blue, with some possible very weak broad features between 5000 and
6500 Ang.

The 55 Hz signal we detected in the power spectra of MAXI J1820+070 (Atel
11951) is not a QPO related to the source physics. This signal is due to
the small gaps in the GTI file (see ""NICERDAS-CalibGuide"" slide 4).

On behalf of a Danish Summer School in Observational Astrophysics currently
being held at the Nordic Optical Telescope, 
we report the spectroscopic classification of ASASSN-18sg (IAU name SN
2018fcw). The candidate was discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey
for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN: Shappee et al. 2014) on 2018-08-14.9 at an apparent
g-band magnitude of 17.6. The host galaxy is 2MASS J00505596-0745536. 

Observations were performed with the 2.56 m Nordic Optical Telescope equipped
with ALFOSC (range 350-950 nm; resolution 1.6 nm FWHM) on 2018-08-17.1.
Inspection of the spectrum indicates this is a Type-Ia supernova at or
around maximum light. Comparison to a library of template supernovae spectra
using SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007) reveals good matches with the normal
SN 2006ax and SN 2007F a few days before maximum light. SNID computes a
redshift of z=0.055.

likely a supernova or CV, in the field currently being observed by TESS.

ASASSN-18sk (AT 2018fdx)  was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-08-15.93
at g~16.1 mag. We also detect the object in images obtained on 2018-08-14.97

ATEL #11965,Optical,"
ePESSTO, the extended Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transient Objects
(see Smartt et al. 2015, A&A, 579, 40 http://www.pessto.org ), reports
the following supernova classifications. Targets were supplied by the ATLAS
survey, see Tonry et al. (2011, PASP, 123, 58) and Tonry et al. (ATel #8680);
the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae ASAS-SN (see Shappee et al.
2014, ApJ, 788, 48 and http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~assassin/index.shtml);
and the ESA Gaia Photometric Science Alerts Team and DPAC (http://gsaweb.ast.cam.ac.uk/alerts).
All observations were performed on the ESO New Technology Telescope at
La Silla on 2018 August 16, using EFOSC2 and Grism 13 (3985-9315A, 18A
resolution). Classifications were done with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007,
ApJ, 666, 1024) and GELATO (Harutyunyan et al., 2008,  A&A, 488, 383).
Classification spectra and additional details can be obtained from http://www.pessto.org

(2) The spectrum is blue and largely featureless, with a weak narrow emission
feature at ~4690 Ang, possibly on top of a broader (~100 Ang) bump. A second
narrow, weak feature also appears to be present at 4155 Ang. We note that
the ~4690 Ang feature is close to the rest wavelength of HeII, raising
the possibility that this is a foreground Galactic transient.

ATEL #11957,X-ray,"
Following the INTEGRAL discovery of the new transient IGR J17591-2342 
and its precise localization by the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory (ATel
#11941, #11942), 
we asked for target-of-opportunity observations with NuSTAR and NICER.

NuSTAR observed the source from 2018-08-13 at 22:36 to 08-14 at 14:26 for

an exposure of 27 ks. NICER observed from 2018-08-15 at 00:01 to 08-15
at 14:08:00 for a total exposure of 7.2 ks. 
Timing analysis of both data sets revealed that the new transient is an
accreting millisecond pulsar (AMSP) 
in outburst with a spin frequency of ~527 Hz, an orbital period of 0.37
days, 
projected semi-major axis of ~1.23 lt-s, and ascending node epoch MJD 58343.7.

The 3-30 keV flux as measured by NuSTAR was 4.2 &times;10<sup>-10</sup>
erg/s/cm<sup>-2</sup>, 
corresponding to a luminosity of 3&times;10<sup>36</sup>erg/s at 8 kpc
distance. 
The 0.1-10 keV flux measured by NICER was 1.3&times;10<sup>-10</sup> ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s.

The spectrum could be described with absorbed thermal Comptonization plus
a soft black-body, 
as usually observed for this class of sources. 

The significance of the periodicity detection is more than five sigmas
in <~ 1 ksec exposures in both datasets, 
but the spin and orbital parameter values should be considered as preliminary
at the current status of analysis. 
We note that the ATCA radio flux reported in ATel #11954 is about three
times larger than for other 
two AMSP (see e.g., Fig. 6 in <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.470..324T"",
target=""_blank"">Tudor at al., 2017</a>). 

Multi-wavelength observations are encouraged to follow up the source outburst
evolution 
together with the approved Swift monitoring. We thank the Swift, NuSTAR
and NICER teams for 
scheduling and performing these observations on a short notice. 
NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space
Station; the NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities
are funded by NASA. 

"
ATEL #11958,Optical,"
On behalf of a Danish Summer School in Observational Astrophysics currently
being held at the Nordic Optical Telescope, 
we report the spectroscopic classification of ASASSN-18rt (IAU name SN
2018fav). 
The candidate was discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae
(ASAS-SN: Shappee et al. 2014) on 2018-08-12.9 with an apparent g-band
magnitude of 18. The host galaxy is 2MASX J00455851-2156353 and has a redshift
of z=0.037923 (Jones et al. 2009). 

Observations were performed with the 2.56 m Nordic Optical Telescope equipped
with ALFOSC (range 350-950 nm; resolution 1.6 nm FWHM) on 2018-08-16.2.
Close inspection of the spectrum reveals it to most likely be a Type-Ic
around maximum light. Comparison of the spectrum with a library of template
spectra using SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007) reveals decent matches with
SN 2004aw around maximum light. 

"
ATEL #11959,Optical,"
We report on spectroscopic confirmation of ASASSN-18pf as a classical nova.
The optical transient was reported by Stanek et al. (2018, ATel #11857)
as a possible LMC nova on on 2018 Jul. 13.4. The discovery magnitude (V
~ 13) is consistent with that of a nova in the LMC during the decline from
maximum light.   

We obtained two (low and medium resolution) spectra of the source with
the Goodman spectrograph on the SOAR telescope on 2018 Aug 15.4 and 16.4
(R ~ 1000 and R ~ 5000, respectively). The spectra are dominated by emission
lines of H I, He I, N, Fe II, C, and O (see below a full list of the line
identification). We measure a FWHM of ~1300 &plusmn; 50 km/s (for H&#945;
and H&#946;). The spectra is that of a classical nova in the transition
phase. The central wavelength of the Balmer emission lines, as measured
by Gaussian fitting, is red-shifted by ~ 290 km/s consistent with LMC radial
velocities. 

Line identifications: 

H I (Balmer): 3835, 3889, 4102, 4340, 4861, and 6563&#8491; 

He I: 4026, 4438, 4471, 5016, 5048, 5876, 6678, and 7065&#8491; 

He II: 4686 and 5412&#8491;  

N II: 5001, 5679, 5938, and 6482&#8491;

ATEL #11954,Radio,"
Following the recent report of the new X-ray transient IGR J17591-2342
(Atels #11941, #11942, #11946), we conducted DDT radio observations with
the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA).  

We observed IGR J17591-2342 on 2018 August 14 between 10:38 UT and 16:23
UT (MJD 58344.56 +/- 0.12). The radio observations were taken simultaneously
at central frequencies of 5.5 and 9.0 GHz, with 2 GHz of bandwidth at each
frequency. PKS 1934-638 and 1817-254 were used for flux and phase calibration,
respectively. The data were reduced and imaged following standard procedures
in CASA (v4.7; McMullin et al. 2007). Imaging was carried out with a Briggs
robust parameter of 0 to both balance sensitivity with resolution, as well
as minimise the effects from diffuse emission and other bright sources
in the field. With the telescope in a hybrid 1.5D configuration due to
a current reconfiguration, these choices provided angular resolutions of
6.8""x1.4"" at 5.5 GHz and 3.9""x0.9"" at 9 GHz (with a position angle 15 degrees
North of East). 

We significantly detected the radio counterpart to IGR J17591-2342 at a
position coincident with the reported X-ray position (ATel #11942). We
measure a 9.0 GHz radio position of: 

RA (J2000) =17:59:02.86 +/- 0.04, Dec (J2000) = -23:43:08.3 +/- 0.1, 

where the errors are the uncertainties on the fitted position, which are
larger than the theoretical statistical error of centroiding (Beam/2*SNR).

Fitting for a point source in the image plane, we measure a flux density
of 1.09 +/- 0.02 mJy at 5.5 GHz and 1.14 +/- 0.02 mJy at 9.0 GHz. The results
give a radio spectral index, &alpha;, of 0.1 +/- 0.3, where S<sub>&nu;</sub>
&prop; &nu;<sup>&alpha;</sup>, suggesting a flat spectrum from a compact
radio jet. This spectral index implies a 5-GHz radio luminosity of (4.7
+/- 0.2)E29*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup> erg/s. 

Swift/XRT observed IGR J17591-2342 on the same day as our radio observation
(snapshots were taken either side of the radio observation on 2018 August
14 between 00:37:01-00:43:57 UT and 16:27:02-16:33:58 UT; obs ID: 0001084002).
We extracted the data using the online XRT pipeline (Evans et al. 2009)
and fitted it with an absorbed power-law model. We find a best fit with
n<sub>H</sub> = (4.4 +/- 0.8)E22 cm<sup>-2</sup> and a photon index, Gamma,
of 1.6 +/- 0.3, with an unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux of (3.4 +/- 1.5)E-10
erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>, similar to previously reported results (ATel #11942),
albeit at a marginally lower X-ray flux, indicating the source has faded
slightly. This flux implies an 0.5-10 keV luminosity of (3 +/- 1)E36*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup>
erg/s. 

Comparing the determined radio and X-ray luminosities to those of typical
hard state X-ray binaries, our results imply that IGR J17591-2342 is consistent
with a black hole low-mass X-ray binary, most likely on the radio bright
track. 

We thank Jamie Stevens and the ATNF staff for making these ATCA observations
possible.

ATEL #11956,TeV,"
The H.E.S.S. array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes was used
to carry  
out follow-up observations of AT2018cow (ATel #11727) between the 3rd and
5th  
July 2018, for a total of 2.4 hours. H.E.S.S. observed the region around
the source  
position (RA, Dec) = (244.00, 22.27) from ATel #11727.  
Preliminary off-site calibration and analysis with the data taken by the
CT5 telescope  
(CT5 mono), searching for a point-like gamma-ray source from the source
target, revealed  
no significant detection.  These observations allowed us to place preliminary

upper limits on the integrated flux (assuming a spectral index value of
-2) from the source target:  
above the energy threshold 220 GeV (with a 95% confidence limit) an upper
limit of 5e-12 ph cm^-2 s^-1; above 1 TeV (with a 95% confidence limit)
an upper limit of 5e-13 ph cm^-2 s^-1.  

H.E.S.S. is an array of five imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes for
the detection  
of very-high-energy gamma-ray sources and is located in the Khomas Highlands
in  
Namibia. It was constructed and is operated by researchers from Armenia,
Australia,  
Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Japan,
Poland,  
South Africa, Sweden, UK, and the host country, Namibia.

ATEL #11950,Supernovae,"
A. J. Nayana (NCRA-TIFR) and Poonam Chandra (NCRA-TIFR) report on behalf

We observed broad lined Type Ic supernova AT2018cow (Smartt et al. ATel#

UT in the 1390 MHz band. We clearly detect radio emission at the supernova
position. The flux density of the supernova in this band is 438+/-82 uJy.

More observations are planned. We thank GMRT staff for carrying out the

ATEL #11951,X-ray,"
We report the detection of a 55 Hz high-frequency QPO in the new black
hole transient MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11488, #11510, #11576, #11578, #11820).
We analysed the NICER observations of MAXI J1820+070 during March 12 to
April 16 (ObsId 1200120101-1200120130). For the timing analysis, we produced
a 16-s power density spectra (PDS) for each observation with a time resolution
of 2 ms, so that the Nyquist frequency is 256 Hz. We find a clear high-frequency
QPO in the PDS of ObsID 1200120107. The centroid frequency of the QPO obtained
from the fit with a model of multiple Lorentzian functions is 55.12+/-0.06
Hz, the FWHM is 2.00+/-0.20 Hz, the fractional rms is about 1%. A weak
second harmonic at the frequency of ~110 Hz was also present in the PDS.
The high-frequency QPO was clearly detected until the observation 1200120120.
During this period, the centroid frequency of the QPO was stable at ~55
Hz. 

The frequency of this high-frequency QPO in MAXI J1820+070 is close to
the 67-Hz QPO seen in GRS 1915+105. However, the 67-Hz QPO in GRS 1915+105
normally appears in a relatively soft state, but the 55-Hz QPO we observed
in MAXI J1820+070 is present in the hard state. We are making a detailed
analysis on this QPO to explore its physical origin. 

"
ATEL #11953,Optical,"
We obtained a spectrum of the nuclear transient AT 2018dyk/ZTF18aajupnt
on 2018 August 12.3 UT with the robotic FLOYDS instrument mounted on the
Las Cumbres Observatory 2-meter telescope on Haleakala, Hawai'i, under
the ""Transients in Galaxy Centers"" program (PI: Arcavi). Using Superfit
(Howell et al. 2005, ApJ, 634, 1190), we find a reasonable fit to the tidal
disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14ae (Holoien et al. 2014, MNRAS, 445, 3263;
Arcavi et al. 2014, ApJ, 793, 38) at the redshift of the host galaxy (z=0.037;
SDSS). 

The spectrum displays possible broad H-alpha, H-beta and He II emission
lines, similar to those seen in other TDEs. Unlike other TDEs, however,
it displays narrow H-beta and He II emission lines not seen in the SDSS
host spectrum, stronger narrow H-alpha compared to the SDSS host spectrum,
and it does not display a blue continuum. 

The ZTF light curve retrieved from the ZTF public alert stream via MARS
(https://mars.lco.global/7014426/) peaks at an apparent magnitude of about
18.6, which at the deduced redshift corresponds to an absolute magnitude
of -17.4, several magnitudes fainter than most TDEs but similar to the
TDE iPTF16fnl (Blagorodnova et al. 2017, ApJ, 844, 46). 

The SDSS spectrum of the host galaxy shows weak H-alpha emission indicative
of only weak current star formation, and does not show strong Balmer absorption
which would be indicative of a recent strong starburst. The recent star
formation history of the host galaxy appears similar to that of TDE PTF09ge
(Arcavi et al. 2014, ApJ, 793, 38), which formed less than 1% of its current
stellar mass in the last Gyr (French et al. 2016, ApJL, 818, 21; French
et al. 2017, ApJ, 835, 176).

ATEL #11952,X-ray,"
The X-ray monitor JEM-X on-board the INTEGRAL satellite has discovered
a new X-ray transient source during the recent Galactic Bulge observation
performed on August 11<sup>th</sup> (revolution 1986) from UTC 07:44 to
12:30 (ATel #438, Kuulkers et al. 2007, A&A 466, 595, see also: <A href=""http://integral.esac.esa.int/BULGE"">http://integral.esac.esa.int/BULGE</A>).

The source is detected at 7 &sigma; for an effective exposure time of 17.9
ks on the combined JEM-X mosaics from which we obtain the following fluxes:

12 &plusmn;2 mCrab (&approx;2.0&times;10<sup>-10</sup> erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s)
between 3-10 keV, 

17 &plusmn;3 mCrab (&approx;1.9&times;10<sup>-10</sup> erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s)
between 10-25 keV. 

JEM-X sees the source at the following position: 

RA = 267.58&deg;, Dec = -26.61&deg; with an uncertainty of 1.5 arcmin 

leading to the new source name: IGR J17503-2636. 

The source is not detected by IBIS/ISGRI above 20 keV, and we estimate
a 3-&sigma; upper limit about 10 mCrab (20-40 keV). 

Thanks to a 1-ks exposure with Swift/XRT in PC mode between August 13<sup>th</sup>
19:41-20:13 (UTC) we can refine the source position at: 

RA = 267.57527&deg; = 17h 50m 18.06s 

Dec = -26.60458&deg; = -26d 36m 16.5s. 

The error radius is 2.2 arcsec (90% confidence) obtained with the enhanced
method using Swift/UVOT  provided by the on-line Swift/XRT data product
tool (Evans et al. 2009, MNRAS 397, 1177). 

The Swift/XRT 0.3-10 keV count rate was increasing between the two snapshots
from 0.3 to 0.5 c/s. The average spectrum is highly absorbed with a derived
absorption column between (6.2-13.7)&times;10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>
(for a galactic column density of 1.3&times;10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>
in that direction). The observed 0.3-10 keV flux is estimated between (2.0-8.3)&times;10<sup>-11</sup>
erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s. 

The next INTEGRAL observations of the Galactic Bulge region are currently
scheduled on August 17<sup>th</sup>  and will continue at a rough cadence
of one-two observations per week until October 20<sup>th</sup>.  
Multi-wavelength follow-up observations are encouraged to unveil the nature
of IGR J17503-2636. 

We thank the Swift Team for scheduling the ToO observation with short notice.

ATEL #11946,Optical,"		Neutron Star, Transient

On 2018 August 10 to 11, IGR J17591-2342 was discovered as a new X-ray
transient by INTEGRAL, confirmed on August 12 with a refined position by
Swift (ATel #11941, #11942). We report on optical observations of the field
of IGR J17591-2342 taken with the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) 2-m and
1-m robotic telescopes. 

Images were acquired with the 2-m Faulkes Telescope South (FTS; located
at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia) in SDSS g', i' and PanSTARRS y-band
filters on 2018 Aug 12 at 13:41-13:57 UT (less than 4 hours after the announcement
of the discovery in ATel #11941). Images in SDSS r', i' and PanSTARRS y-band
filters were taken on 2018 Aug 12 at 21:05-21:23 UT using a 1-m LCO telescope
at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), Sutherland, South
Africa. Finally, images in g', i' and y-band filters were taken on 2018
Aug 13 at 6:30-6:46 UT with the 2-m Faulkes Telescope North (FTN; at Haleakala
Observatory, Maui, Hawaii, USA). 

We flux calibrate our images using several close, isolated stars listed
in the PanSTARRS catalogue. We also aligned and combined the FTS and FTN
images taken in g', i' and y-bands to produce deeper images in these three
filters (finding charts are linked below). No stars are detected within
the 3.6 arcsec radius Swift XRT error circle of the X-ray source (ATel
#11942), although one star is clearly detected on the edge of the error
circle in all our images (labelled '1' in the i'-band finding chart below),
which is also listed in the PanSTARRS and 2MASS catalogues. Its PanSTARRS
coordinates (J2000) are RA = 17 59 02.693; Dec = -23 43 12.04 (3.7"" from
the centre of the XRT circle) and catalogue magnitudes are g' = 25.468
+- ? (no error given); r' = 19.767 +- 0.036; i' = 17.737 +- 0.011; y =
15.505 +- 0.013. We derive magnitudes of this star from each of our images;
all our r', i' and y mags agree with the catalogue values within < 0.1
+- 0.1 mag. From the combined FTS and FTN g'-band image, we measure g'
= 23.0 +- 0.2 for this star - significantly brighter than the PanSTARRS
value, although we suspect this apparent brightening may not be real, and
could be due to the unknown error on the PanStarrs catalogue g'-band magnitude,
and/or the low S/N of the star in our image. 

The next three closest PanSTARRS stars are located 5.5"" to 6.2"" from the
centre of the XRT error circle (labelled 2 to 4 in the i'-band finding
chart). Star 2 is detected in y-band only; its magnitudes agree within
0.2 +- 0.2 mags of PanSTARRS. Star 3 is not detected in any filter. Star
4 (at RA = 17 59 02.505; Dec = -23 43 07.93) has magnitudes that are brighter
than the catalogue values by 0.15-0.19 mag in all i' and y images (it is
not significantly detected in g' and r'). Within the 3.6"" XRT error circle,
there are no additional sources detected in the combined images down to
magnitude (3-sigma) limits of g' = > 22.7; i' > 21.8; y > 18.4. We will
continue to image the location with the LCO telescopes while the X-ray
flux increases, to see if any star brightens. 

The Galactic neutral hydrogen column density in the direction of IGR J17591-2342
is n_H ~ 1.4E22 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005, A&A, 440, 775; Dickey & Lockman,
1990, ARAA, 28, 215). The absorption column density from the Swift XRT
spectrum was measured to be n_H = (4.2+/-0.8)x1E22 cm^-2, exceeding the
Galactic value. Given these two values and adopting the relation of Guver
& Ozel (2009, MNRAS, 400, 2050), the optical extinction is likely to lie
in the range Av ~ 6 - 23. Infrared and longer wavelength observations (e.g.
radio) are therefore strongly encouraged. 

The LCO observations are part of an on-going <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/faulkesxrb"">monitoring
campaign</a> of ~ 40 low-mass X-ray binaries (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2751"">Lewis
et al. 2008</a>) with LCO and the Faulkes Telescopes. This work makes use
of observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO).

1) Only blue channel spectrum available.<br /> 
2) Between 2 SDSS galaxies, the SNID redshift is consistent with photoZ
of SDSSJ161420.50+031357.4 within 2.7 sigma.  We note that ZTF_Bot1 has
since posted a classification to TNS with a redshift of 0.55 (that of the
other coincident galaxy).  This, however, is inconsistent with SNID and
would imply an absolute magnitude of approximately -24. <br /> 
3) Possibly a Ia-norm, but more Ia-91T provide quality fits with SNID.

"
ATEL #11949,Optical,"
Following the report of a weak X-ray outburst from the black hole transient
V4641 Sgr (ATel #11931), we have performed optical follow-up observations
since 2018 August 10. Observations were taken with the T17 0.43m telescope
of iTelescope.Net in Siding Spring, Australia. We used a subset of comparison
stars and the orbital solution in MacDonald et al. (2014) to derive the
magnitude of V4641 Sgr and the corresponding orbital phase, respectively.
The magnitudes of V4641 Sgr are listed below: 

2018-08-10 at Phase 0.72 V=13.44 

2018-08-11 at Phase 0.13 V=13.35 

2018-08-12 at Phase 0.49 V=13.36  B=13.74 

2018-08-13 at Phase 0.84 V=13.66  B=14.01 

with a typical 1-sigma uncertainty of ~0.1 mag. 

By comparing the quiescent light curves in MacDonald et al. (2014), it
is clear that V4641 Sgr shows increased activity in optical on 2018-08-11
and 2018-08-12 with 0.3-0.5 mag enhancement. On 2018-08-13, both the B
and V magnitudes are consistent with quiescence. Our observations indicate
that V4641 Sgr may be in an optical active phase. Further optical and X-ray
observations are encouraged to investigate the nature of this outburst.
Swift observations have been approved to follow up the source.

ATEL #11941,X-ray,"
During the observations performed in satellite revolution 1986 (spanning
from 2018-08-10 15:50 to 2018-08-11 12:30 UT) toward the direction of the
Galactic center, a new X-ray transient was detected by the instruments
on-board INTEGRAL. 

The best position determined by IBIS/ISGRI is at: 

RA, Dec (J2000): 269.78662  -23.712973, 

with an associated uncertainty of 3 arcmin. 

According to the INTEGRAL convention, we named the new transient IGR J17591-2342.

The new source is detected in the 20-40 keV (40-80 keV) mosaic realized
by using all the science windows collected in the direction of the Galactic
Center and Galactic Bulge at a significance of 8.7 sigma (7.7 sigma). The
estimated flux of the source from the mosaic is of 13.5+/-1.5 mCrab in
the 20-40 keV energy band and 21.5+/-2.7 in the 40-80 keV energy band.
These values correspond to roughly 1.0E-10 erg/cm^2/s and 1.6E-10 erg/cm^2/s,
respectively. 

The ISGRI spectrum could be preliminary described by a power-law of photon
index 2.9+/-0.5. The flux measured from the spectral fit in the 20-100
keV energy band was 4.3E-10 erg/cm^2/s. 

The source was located at the rim of the JEM-X field of view and not detected
by this instrument. 

Additional INTEGRAL observation of the field around the new transient are
planned for 2018 August 17. A Swift/XRT ToO observation has been requested.

"
ATEL #11942,X-ray,"
Following the discovery of the new INTEGRAL transient IGRJ17591-2342 (ATel
#11941), a ToO observation with Swift/XRT was requested in order to improve
the determination of the source position and to characterize its soft X-ray
emission. 

Swift/XRT observed the field around IGRJ17591-2342 starting from 12 August
2018 at 03:49 for about 1 ks. A single X-ray source was detected within
the uncertainty circle derived from IBIS/ISGRI. The best position determined
by XRT (we used the online Swift-XRT data product tool; Evans et al. 2009,
MNRAS, 397, 1177):  

RA, Dec (J2000): 269.7622, -23.7195,  

with an associated uncertainty of 3.6 arcsec (at 90% c.l.).  

The Swift/XRT spectrum could be preliminary described by an absorbed power-law
with photon index of 1.7+/-0.3 and an absorption column density of (4.2+/-0.8)x1E22
cm^-2. The 0.3-10 keV flux (not corrected for absorption was (2.6+/-0.2)x1E-10
erg/cm^2/s.  

Additional monitoring observations with Swift/XRT have been requested.
We are grateful to the Swift team for the very rapid scheduling of the
ToO observation of IGR J17591-2342.

(1) Not visible on acquisition image.

(2) Previously classified by SCAT.

(3) The transient is dominated by narrow Balmer emission lines, however
the continuum is remarkably flat. We measure a flux ratio between Halpha
and Hbeta of 3.8. In addition, we see weak narrow emission features from
He I. We also note that the transient may be associated with NGC 6822,
a very nearby dwarf irregular galaxy. Given our spectral resolution and
the small redshift for NGC 6882, we cannot determine whether ATLAS18tcn
lies in this galaxy or the Milky Way.

(4) The spectrum has Balmer emission lines, He, and a blue component to
the continuum consistent with an AGN. This is also consistent with the
location of the transient in the nucleus of its host.

(5) Blue continuum with absorption in Hbeta and higher.

During the ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, <a
href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/%61bs/2014ApJ...788...48S"">Shappee et al.
2014</a>), using data from the quadruple 14-cm ""Payne-Gaposchkin"" telescope
in Sutherland, South Africa, we discovered a new transient source, most
likely a supernova, in the galaxy 2MASS J21483845-4322470. 

ASASSN-18rn (AT 2018evo) was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-08-08.85
at g~18.0 mag. We also detect the object in images obtained on UT 2018-08-12.05

in images taken on UT 2018-08-11.35 and before. Follow-up images confirm
the discovery of the transient. This <a href=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/assassin/followup/asassn-18rn.png>figure</a>
shows the archival DSS image of the host (left) and the confirmation image
(right). The red circle has a radius of 5"" and is centered on the position
of the transient in the confirmation image. 

The position of ASASSN-18rn is approximately 0.6"" South and 3.0"" West from
the center of the galaxy 2MASS J21483845-4322470 (z=0.07389, d=320.9 Mpc,

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient.

ATEL #11945,X-ray,"		Transient

We report new Chandra X-ray observations of neutron star merger GW170817
at 358.6 days post-merger, which now reveals fading at a t^-1.6 rate. 

Chandra obtained a 67.16 ks observation of GW170817 (obsID: 21371, PI:
Troja) on 10 August 2018, at 358.6 days post-merger. GW170817 is still
clearly detected, and we measure a 0.5-8 keV count rate of 4.9 (+0.9/-0.9)
cts/s. We extract and fit the X-ray spectrum assuming an absorbed power-law
spectral model, with fixed NH = 7.5e20 cm^-2. We measure an absorbed flux
of f(0.3-8 keV) = 6.3 (+3.8/-2.1) x10^-15 erg/s/cm^2 (90% c.l.) and photon
index of Gamma = 1.6 (+1.3/-0.9), which corresponds to an unabsorbed luminosity
of L(0.3-10 keV) = 1.7 (+1.1/-0.5) x10^39 erg/s assuming a luminosity distance
of 42.5 Mpc. 

The previous Chandra observation at 260.0 days showed an absorbed flux
of f(0.3-8 keV) = 1.09 (+0.24/-0.20) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2 (Nynka et al. 2018).
A power-law fit of this previous 260.0 day flux to the new 358.6 day flux
reveals fading at a t^-1.6 rate. This is steeper than the t^-1.3 fading
observed between 159.7 and 260.0 days post-merger, and thus the X-ray afterglow
light curve is now fading more rapidly.

MASTER OT J023059.78-172027.1 discovery - OT in far SDSS galaxy direction,
discovered during Fermi 555576051 trigger inspection 

MASTER-SAAO auto-detection system ( Lipunov et al., ""MASTER Global Robotic
Net"", Advances in Astronomy, 2010, 30L )

discovered OT source at (RA, Dec) = 02h 30m 59.78s -17d 20m 27.1s on 2018-08-11.15934
UT 

The OT unfiltered magnitude is 17.5m (mlim=19.7). 

The OT is seen in 4 images. There is no minor planet at this place. 

We have reference image on 2016-05-28.17676 UT with  unfiltered mlim= 
18.6m. 

This OT was found during Fermi trigger <a href="" https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/555576051.fermi"">inspection
</a> (GRBtime=2018-08-10 06:40:46.74UT), but it was presented in MASTER-OAFA
images on 2018-08-08 07:33:12 with m_OT=18.5 (also detected during Fermi
inspection, but trigger number is 555263883 https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/555263883.fermi
) 

There is SDSS galaxy (The SDSS Photometric Catalog, Release 9 
(Adelman-McCarthy, 2012) with 0.25 arcsec offset 
(inside our error box ~0.7 arcsec) with r_m = 22.5 mag .

However, we can not exclude that the object in the SDSS is a star. In 

this case we have an optical transient is CV. 

Finally, we just received a telegram from MASTER-OAFA robotic telescope
(Argentina), that OT magnitude is about 18.0 (Lipunov et al., <A HREF=""https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/23126.gcn3"">GCN
23126</A> ). 

Spectral observations are required.

UT) and 58327.939637 (Jul 28 22:33:04.6 UT). We retained only the observations
with better sky conditions. 

The average background-subtracted rate of MAXI J1820+070 showed night-to-night
variations and was in the range 2300-5700 c/s for IFI+IQUEYE and 35700-39000
c/s for AQUEYE+. The sky background was regularly monitored between on-target
observations. The fractional root-mean-square (rms) variability of the
1s binned (non background-subtracted) IFI+IQUEYE light curve was between
2.7% and 4.2%, and that of the AQUEYE+ light curve between 2.7% and 3.8%.
The two values are slightly larger than those of a nearby reference star
pointed in between on-target observations (1.9-3.8% for IFI+IQUEYE and
2.5-3.0% for AQUEYE+). 

Power spectra of the non-background subtracted light curves with a time
bin of 10 ms were computed for each night and were then averaged over intervals
of 130s duration. The power spectra are characterized by low frequency
broad-band noise components mostly induced by the sky variability. No significant
low frequency quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) were detected in any of
the observations. Using the AQUEYE+ acquisitions of July 18-19, that have
the highest background-subtracted source rate, we can constrain the fractional
rms of a QPO with properties similar to those detected in April and June
(centroid ~100 mHz, width ~20 mHz) to be smaller than ~0.5% (95% confidence).

ATEL #11937,Cataclysmic Variable,"
HBHa 1704-05 was first noted by Kohoutek and Wehmeyer in their catalog
of emission line stars (1999, A&AS, 134, 255), as a source with a strong
continuum (thus not a PN) and overexposed Halpha emission.  It seems not
much else is available in literature.  The star is coincident with 2MASS
J19544295+1722125 (=ASASSN-V J195442.95+172212.6) catalogued by VSX (Otero
2018) as an SR variable with a periodicity around 418 days, and a range
of variability 13.2-12.4 in V band. 

On patrol sky observations obtained with a Canon EOS 1000D plus 180mm focus
lens, one of us (R.F.) recently noted a rapid increase in brightness amounting
to (preliminary calibrated) V~12.0 on July 31.945 UT, V~11.7 on  Aug 3.989,
and V~10.7 mag on Aug 8.938.  The trend was confirmed by  inspection of
the on-line ASASSN database.  An exploratory spectrum was soon obtained
on UT Aug 9.839 by one of us (P.B.) with a 23cm+Lhires III telescope, showing
a rich emission line spectrum that prompted to collect  deeper observations.

On UT Aug 10.837 we have observed HBHa 1704-05 with ANS Collaboration
telescope ID 310 obtaining B=11.459, V=10.926, R=10.101, and I=9.199. Comparing
with APASS mean values for quiescence, B=13.798 and V=12.637, the object
is now 2.3 mag brighter in B and far bluer in color (from B-V=+1.16 to
+0.53).   

A deep 3200-7900 Ang spectrum of HBHa 1704-05 was obtained on UT Aug 
10.855 at 2.31 Ang/pix dispersion with the Asiago 1.22m telescope, while
the Varese 84cm provided a high resolution Echelle spectrum on UT Aug 10.882.
The spectrum of HBHa 1704-05 is characterized by TiO absorption bands from
an M giant in the red, progressively veiled by nebular emission toward
the blue, with a prominent Balmer continuum in emission.  A lot of strong
emission lines are present, with HeII 4686 of the same intensity of Hbeta,
and [NeV] 3426 suggesting a photo-ionization temperature in excess of 100,000
K.  A prominent NIII 4640 complex is accompanied by OIV 3411 and OIII 3313,
3429, and 3444, indicating that pumping under Bowen fluorescence, initiated
by HeII Ly-alpha photons at 303.8 Ang, is active. Forbidden lines characterized
by a low critical density are absent, and also absent is the Raman scattered
OVI pair at 6825, 7088 Ang.  On the Echelle spectrum, the emission lines
appear remarkably sharp and symmetric, without P-Cyg absorptions or other
signatures of mass loss being visible, and with broad wings for the Balmer
lines that suggest a large electron pressure.  Bowen-pumped OI 8446 is
present as are low-excitation emission from FeII multiplet 42, NaI D1,D2
and infrared CaII triplet. 

We therefore conclude that HBHa 1704-05 is a previously unknown symbiotic
binary, currently undergoing an ""hot-type"" outburst, with the wind of the
cool giant being increasingly ionized by a hot companion rising in Teff.
Its Gaia parallax suggests a distance of 3.6 kpc (albeit with a large
error), and Schlafly et al.  (2011, ApJ 737, 103) extinction maps indicate
a reddening E(B-V)=0.28.  The latter is confirmed by the low equivalent
width for DIB 6614 and KI 7699.  Combining APASS mean BVgri photometry
in quiescence with 2MASS JHK data, a spectral type around M3III can be
inferred for the M giant, in agreement with M(V)=-1.0 in quiescence from
Gaia parallax. 

The large brightness attended by the ongoing outburst of HBHa 1704-05
and its favorable position on the sky will undoubtedly support a large,
all-out observing effort, we plan to join.

classified as a FeII-type Galactic nova by Williams et al.  (ATel #11928)

The red colors above suggest significant reddening, as confirmed by the
saturated interstellar NaI doublet and the rich assortment of diffuse interstellar
bands (DIBs) we have measured on an high resolution Echelle spectrum (4400-9100
Ang, res.  pow.  15,000) that we have obtained with the 
Varese 84cm telescope on Aug 10.839 UT, at the same time when we also recorded
a low resolution spectrum (3200-7900 Ang, 2.31 Ang/pix) with the Asiago
1.22m telescope.  The equivalent width (E.W.) for interstellar KI 7699
corresponds to E(B-V)=0.94 adopting the calibration of Munari and Zwitter

(1997, A&A 318, 269), and the E.W. of DIB 6614 provides E(B-V)=1.01 from
Munari (2014, ASPC 490, 183).  The E.W. of DIBs at 5780 and 5797 correspond,
respectively, to E(B-V)=0.92 and 1.04 applying Kos and Zwitter (2013, ApJ
774, 72) relations.  The overall average is E(B-V)=0.98 +/- 0.02. 

Significant evolution has occurred since the spectral observation by Williams
et al.  (ATel #11928), primarily a reduction in excitation and in line
width and velocity, as usual during the rise to maximum.  The HeI lines
are gone, and now a greater number of low-excitation emission lines are
present over the whole spectral range, all displaying P-Cyg profiles, with
the equivalent width of the absorption component rivaling or surpassing
the emission one.  Lines from a large number of FeII multiplets are present,
CaII H and K, near-IR CaII triplet, Balmer and Paschen series, NaI, OI
7772 and 8446 (not yet Bowen pumped).  The P-Cyg profiles are now perfectly
fitted by a combination of two Gaussians, with no extended wings.  The
velocity shift from emission of P-Cyg absorptions range now from about
-580 km/s for FeII, to -650 for Hbeta, to -710 for OI. The width of emission
and absorption components also vary among ions and lines, from 1100 and
760 km/s (respectively) for Hbeta to 730 and 460 km/s for OI. 

"
ATEL #11931,X-ray,"
We report recent activity of the micro-quasar V4641 Sgr (= SAX 1819.3–2525).
Since the end of 2018 July, MAXI/GSC detected weak, soft enhancement from
the position consistent with V4641 Sgr. The average 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV
X-ray fluxes  on August 1-8 
(MJD 58331-58338) are (8.6+/-1.5)e-3 c/s/cm2 (~8 mCrab) and (5.9+/-1.7)e-3
c/s/cm2 (~ 6 mCrab), respectively.

The source also showed similar weak (6-10 mCrab) activity from 2018 April
4 to April 10 (MJD 58212-58218). We also note that the source was marginally
detected between these two outbursts at a flux level of (1.6+/-0.5)e-3
c/s/cm2 at the 2-4 keV band, suggesting continuous activity of the source
since the outburst in April. 

The source exhibited several weak outbursts after the very bright outburst
in 1999. The previous outbursts that MAXI/GSC detected at flux levels of
3 mCrab are in 2010 September (ATel #2785, #2832, #2892), 2012 June (ATel
#5803, #5836), 2014 February (ATel #7858, #7874, #7904, #7908, #7966),
and 2015 July. No apparent periodicity is found. These data, however suggest
that weak outbursts occur at intervals of 500-600 days though an outburst
around 2017 December when the source was in an unobservable sky region
was not confirmed. 

Multiwavelength monitoring of the source is encouraged.

ATEL #11932,Radio,"
Three new Fast Radio Burst were detected with the radio telescope BSA LPI
of the Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory of the Lebedev Physical Institute
(100 km south from Moscow) at the frequency 111 MHz during processing of
archival data of scintillation of radio source on inhomogeneities of interplanetary
plasma in period from 2012 to 2018.

The Radio telescope BSA LPI is meridian-type instrument (200m x 400m)
with a central frequency of 111MHz and band width 2.5 MHz. The fluctuation
sensitivity is 140 mJy at time resolution 0.1 s. In so doing the time interval
between samples is 100 ms. The radio telescope has multibeam diagram consisting
of 96 beams. This gives a possibility for continuous monitoring of large
area of the sky (from -8.20 to +42.13 degrees by declination).

The main goal of data processing was to search for pulses from the repeated
FRB 121102. The results are given below: 

FRB 151018 (01:05:48 2015-10-18 UTC): the pulse has coordinates RA(J2000)
= 05:21:00 and DEC(J2000) = +33:06:00. Dispersion measure is 570 pc/cm^3+/-5
pc/cm^3 (DM_Gal=275 pc/cm^3 in accordance with the YMW16 model). A signal-to-noise
ratio S/N ~ 6.2. The peak flux density is ~ 1.4 Jy according to our estimates.
Width of pulse is ~ 2.5 s. 

FRB 160920 (03:05:43 2016-09-20 UTC): the pulse has coordinates RA(J2000)
= 05:34:00 and DEC(J2000) = +41:45:00. Dispersion measure is 1767 pc/cm^3+/-4
pc/cm^3 (DM_Gal=250 pc/cm^3 in accordance with the YMW16 model). A signal-to-noise
ratio S/N ~ 9.1. The peak flux density is ~ 0.22 Jy. Width of pulse is
~ 5 s. 

FRB 170606 (10:03:27 2017-06-06 UTC): coordinates of pulse are RA(J2000)=
05:34:00 and DEC(J2000)= +41:45:00. Dispersion measure is 247 pc/cm^3+/-5
pc/cm^3. A signal-to-noise ratio S/N ~ 8.3. The peak flux density is ~
0.54 Jy. Width of pulse is ~ 3.3 s. 

Each pulse is visible only in one beam of multibeam diagram of BSA LPI.
Since the width of the main lobe of the beam pattern of the BSA LPI radio
telescope at half the level is ~ 30', these coordinates have comparable
error. 

The coordinates of FRB 151018 coincide with coordinates of the repeated
FRB 121102 within the error. Therefore, we can say with a high probability
that pulse of known FRB 121102 was detected for the first time at the frequency
111 MHz. From here we can draw a conclusion about the spectral index of
the event FRB 121102. Based on our  estimates at 111 MHz and earlier measurements
at different frequencies the spectral index v ~ -0.6+/-0.4.

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient. 

We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their
continued support of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation through grant GBMF5490 to the Ohio State University,
NSF grant AST-1515927, the Mt. Cuba Astronomical Foundation, the Center

ATEL #11926,Cataclysmic Variable,"
Y. Nakamura (CBET #4514) on UT 2018 April 29.474 discovered the 
cataclysmic variable V392 Per to have erupted into a nova, peaking at 
V~6.2.  The nova was immediately detected as a strong gamma-ray source
by   
Fermi-LAT (Li et al.  ATel #11590), and three months later as an X-ray
source 
when the Sun-constraint was lifted and the nova could be pointed by Swift

(Darnley et al.  ATel #11905). 

On UT Aug. 9.083 we observed Nova V392 Per with the Asiago 67/92cm 
Schmidt telescope in BVgri bands.  Calibration into the APASS photometric

system provides B=15.250, V=14.267, g'=14.801, r'=14.000 and i'=13.671,
with 
transformation errors about 0.005 mag in all bands.  Simultaneous with
the   
photometric observations, we obtained a deep spectrum of the nova with
the  
Asiago 1.22m telescope, at a dispersion of 2.31 Ang/pix (for a resolving
power  
1100) and over the wavelength interval 3300-8000 Ang.  The mid exposure
time 
was UT Aug 9.061. 

Compared to spectral observations just before (Tomov et al., ATel #11605)

and soon after the Solar conjunction (Darnley, ATel #11846 and #11872),

large changes have occoured.  The transition to advanced nebular conditions
is 
in place, with [OIII] 4959+5007 now 3.6 times the integrated flux of 
Halpha+[NII].  All emission lines result now composed by two broad and
well   
separated components (both with a FWHM ~1800 km/sec; exact values range
from 
1500 to 2000 km/sec depending from the line).  The bluer component is now

generally the strongest.  The velocity separation of these broad components

ranges from 3400 km/s for Halpha up to 4500 km/sec for [NeV] 3426 Ang (well

matching the FWHM=5200 km/s of the single peaked line profiles observed
at 
the start of the eruption, Wagner et al., ATel #11588).  A narrow and 
low-velocity component is visible in most of the lines, its width unresolved

at our instrumental resolution (thus < 200 km/s).  The peak intensity of

this central, narrow component (Nw) varies greatly from line to line 
compared to the intensity of the broad components (BC), ranging 
from Nw >> BC for HeII 4686, to Nw > BC for HeI lines, Nw ~ BC for Balmer

lines, Nw << BC for [NeIII], [OIII], [NII], and absent for [NeV].  Such

profiles for the emission lines are closely similar to those observed at

late stages in the extremely fast and He/N V2672 Nova Oph 2009, modelled
by 
Munari et al.  (2011, MNRAS 410, 525) as a bipolar flow aligned with the

line of sight plus an equatorial torus seen face-on. 

The large intensity of Neon lines, in particular [NeV] 3426 comparable
in intensity to 
Halpha+[NII], suggest V392 Per to be a Neon Nova.  The integrated flux
of   
the two broad components of [NeV] 3426 is 4.5x10(-13) erg/cm2sec, and 
3.5x10(-13) for [NeIII] 3869.  The integrated flux of the narrow central

peak for [NeIII] 3869 is 1.5x10(-14), or 4% of the broad components.  [NeIV]

4715 is probably present too, but too heavily blended with HeII 4686 and
the 
NIII 4640 complex for a reliable detection.  

"
ATEL #11927,X-ray,"
The MAXI/GSC nova-alert system (Negoro et al. 2016, PASJ, 68, S1) detected
a weak X-ray flux enhancement from the Galactic plane (l,b) = (22.0, 0.0)
on 2018-08-06T17:04(UT).  Assuming that the source flux was constant over
8 times scan transit (2018-08-07T05:26(UT) to 16:15), we have obtained
the source position at (R.A., Dec) = (277.752 deg, -9.630 deg) = (18 31
00, -09 37 48) (J2000) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region
with long and short radii of 0.34 deg and 0.31 deg, respectively.  The
roll angle of long axis from the north direction is 172.0 deg counterclockwise.
There is an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment
radius).  This position nicely matched with the 7.8 second transient X-ray
pulsar XTE J1829-098 ((RA,DEC)=(277.43,-9.86)) (Markwardt et al. 2004,
Atel#317).  This is the first detection of XTE J1829-098 by MAXI/GSC since
August 2009. 

The MAXI/GSC data shows that the present brightening started from 2018-08-05
(MJD 58335).  The daily averaged 4-10 keV flux reached 0.028 +- 0.005 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup>
(24 +- 4 mCrab) on 2018-08-07 (MJD 58337), and slightly decreased to 0.021
+- 0.005 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (18 +- 4 mCrab) on 2018-08-08 (MJD 58338).
This X-ray flux variation traces the previous outburst profile, a duration
of &sim;7 days (Markwardt et al. 2009, Atel#2007).  The 2-10 keV X-ray
spectrum integrated over 4 days (MJD 58335-58338) can be described by unabsorbed
power-law model with photon index of 0.31<sup>+0.48</sup><sub>-0.52</sub>
(90% C.L.), which is consistent with the previous report of &Gamma; = 0.76
+- 0.13 (Halpern et al. 2007, ApJ, 669, 579).  The observed luminosity
in 2-10 keV energy band is 3.6&times;10<sup>36</sup> (d/10 kpc)<sup>2</sup>
erg s<sup>-1</sup>, which is larger than the previous outburst peak luminosity
by a factor of &sim;4. 

Previously, two outburst periodicities were claimed by Halpern et al. 2007
(&sim;1.3yr) and Markwardt et al. 2009 (&sim;246d).  The multiple of the
above two periods do not match with the time interval between the current
brightening and the last outburst in 2009.  However if small modifications
(a few days) are applied on both periodicities, the time interval becomes
multiple of its.  Moreover, the time interval is 14 times the modified
Markwardt's prediction of &sim;243d (or half of the Halpern's period).
Therefore, we can not rule out each periodicity.

ATEL #11928,Optical,"
We obtained a spectrum of PNV J17422408-2053088 (see <a href=""http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/unconf/followups/J17422408-2053088.html"">CBAT
TOCP</a>) on 2018 Aug 9.93 UT. The spectrum was taken with the FRODOSpec
spectrograph (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AN....333..101B"">Barnsley
et al. 2012</a>) on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5489..679S"">Steele
et al. 2004</a>), with a wavelength coverage of 3900 to 5100 &Aring; and
5900 to 8000 &Aring; and resolution of R ~ 5400.   

The spectrum shows strong Balmer lines which exhibit P-Cygni profiles,
with the edge of the H&alpha; absorption component indicating a maximum
velocity of -1600 km/s. We identify O I (7773 &Aring;), N I (7424, 7442
and 7468 &Aring;) and Si II (6347 and 6371 &Aring;), all of which show
P-Cygni profiles. The spectrum displays numerous Fe II lines, including
those at 4179, 4233, 4385, 4556, 4584, 4629, 4924, 5018, 6148, 6248 and
6456 &Aring;. The majority of the Fe II lines can also clearly be seen
to show P-Cygni profiles. In addition, weak He I features are present at
6678 and 7065&Aring;. 

This spectrum shows PNV J17422408-2053088 is a Galactic nova (Fe II type)
in the early stages of an eruption.

afterglow, before its current fading (e.g., Nynka et al., 2018, Alexander
et al. 2018). 

XMM-Newton obtained a 111.5 ks observation of GW170817 (obsID: 0811212701)
on 26 January 2018 UT, approximately 162 days post-merger. We extract and
fit the X-ray spectrum assuming an absorbed power-law spectral model with
fixed NH = 7.5e20 cm^-2. We measure an absorbed flux of f(0.3-8 keV) =
1.7 (+0.6/-0.5) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2 (all uncertainties are 90% c.l.) and
photon index of Gamma = 1.61 (+0.26/-0.24), which corresponds to an unabsorbed
luminosity of L(0.3-10 keV) = 4.6 (+1.5/-1.5) x10^39 erg/s assuming a luminosity
distance of 42.5 Mpc. 

Our results from this XMM-Newton observation of GW170817 at 162 days are
consistent with our Chandra observations at 159.7 days, which revealed
an absorbed flux of f(0.3-8 keV) = 2.06 (+0.34/-0.30) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2
and Gamma = 1.58 (+0.23/-0.22) (Nynka et al., 2018). A joint spectral fit
of both the XMM-Newton observation at 162 days and Chandra observations
at 159.7 days gives Gamma = 1.60 (+0.17/-0.17). 

Previously, XMM-Newton also obtained a 44.2ks DDT observation of GW170817
at 135 days post-merger (PI: Schartel, obsID: 0811210101). From this data,
D'Avanzo et al. (2018) measured an unabsorbed flux of f(0.3-10 keV) = 2.1
(+1.1/-0.8) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2 and Gamma = 1.7 (+0.5/-0.4), which corresponds
to an absorbed flux of f(0.3-8 keV) = 1.7 (+1.1/-0.8) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2.
This XMM-Newton flux measurement at 135 days was surprisingly fainter than
our previous Chandra measurement at 109.2 days (Ruan et al., 2018), as
well our later Chandra measurement at 159.7 days (Nynka et al., 2018),
although the uncertainties are large. We provide a independent reanalysis
of this XMM-Newton data at 135 days, and find a unabsorbed flux of f(0.3-10
keV) = 2.4 (+1.1/-0.9) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2 (equivalent to an absorbed flux
of 1.9 (+1.7/-0.9) x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2 in the 3-8 keV band) and Gamma =
1.7 (+0.8/-0.6), slightly brighter than previously reported and more consistent
with our Chandra observations. 

Below, we provide a light curve table of all currently-available Chandra
and XMM-Newton observations of GW170817. We note that all flux and luminosity
measurements are from our own independent analysis of the data (reported
here and in Nynka et al., 2018), except for the Chandra observations at
2.3 days, which are rescaled from Margutti et al. (2017).

We obtained a spectrum of classical nova candidate PNV J00424214+4114457
(see ATel #11904) with the SPRAT spectrograph (R~350; <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9147E..8HP"">Piascik
et al. 2014</a>) on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5489..679S"">Steele
et al. 2004</a>) on 2018 August 7.06 UT. 

The spectrum shows strong Balmer emission lines (H&alpha;, H&beta;, H&gamma;,
H&delta;) with a FWHM of about 1700 km/s. We also detect three emission
lines from multiplet 42 of Fe II.  

We conclude that PNV J00424214+4114457 is a nova eruption within M31 and
it is likely to belongs to the Fe II taxonomic class.  

Follow-up observations are encouraged.

ATEL #11918,X-ray,"
4U 1538-52 is a bright eclipsing high-mass X-ray binary containing a 
neutron star accreting from the wind of QV Nor, a B0Iab star. 

We calculated the power spectrum of the Swift BAT light curve from the

transient monitor program (Krimm et al. 2013, ApJS, 209, 14) covering 
the energy range 15 - 50 keV, and a time range of MJD 53416 to 58318 
(2005-02-15 to 2018-07-19) for periods from 0.07 days to the length of

the light curve. The power spectrum is dominated by very strong peaks 
at the orbital period and its harmonics. However, in addition, we 
noted a peak near 14.9 days at a height of ~22.5 times the mean power 
level with a nominal false alarm probability (FAP) of 10^-5. To 
further investigate this modulation, we removed data within +/- 0.15 
in phase of the eclipse center, using the ephemeris of Mukherjee et 
al. (2006, JApA, 27, 411).  From a power spectrum of this modified 
light curve, the orbital modulation was strongly reduced, and the only

significant peak was near 14.9 days at a height ~30 times the local 
power level with an FAP of ~10^-8. The derived period was 14.916 +/- 
0.003 days.  We note that this is consistent, within the errors, with 
four times the orbital period of 3.728382 +/- 0.000011 days. 

We note that both the candidate superorbital period and the orbital 
period of 4U 1538-52 are very similar to those of IGR J16418-4532 
(Corbet & Krimm, 2013, ApJ, 778:45) where the ratio of superorbital to

orbital period is 3.94, and thus would be consistent with the possible

correlation between superorbital and orbital periods in wind-accretion

HMXBs. 

To characterize the modulation near 14.9 days in 4U 1538-52 we also 
made a sine wave fit to the modified light curve.  The mean count rate

is 0.0055 cts/cm^2/s (approximately 25.3 mCrab) and the sine wave 
semi-amplitude is 0.00045 +/- 0.00004 cts/cm^2/s, approximately 2.1 
mCrab. The epoch of maximum flux is MJD 56106.6 +/- 0.2, which is 
0.37 +/- 0.2 days after the time of eclipse center.  We note that because
of 
the exact ratio between the candidate superorbital period and orbital 
period and the phasing, we are not measuring the flux at the implied 
maximum or minimum of the modulation. 

We are not aware of any artifact that would cause modulation at four 
times the orbital period and aligned with the eclipse. We 
investigated the power spectra of BAT light curves of other eclipsing 
supergiant HMXBs without already known superorbital periods for 
similar modulation, and did not see any. Observations at other wavelengths

over the proposed superorbital period are encouraged.

We report on follow-up optical photometric  (MASTER Global Robotic Network)
and  spectral observations (1.9-m SAAO) of the nearby changing look AGN
NGC 1566, which was discovered to be in outburst in hard X-rays by the
INTEGRAL observatory on 2018 June 12-19 (Ducci et al., ATel #11754), and
was then investigated with the Swift observatory (Kuin et al. ATel #11786,
Grupe and Komossa ATel #11903). An ASAS-SN V-band light curve for the period
2014-2018 (Dai et al., ATel #11893) shows that nuclear the outburst became
visible in September 2017. The 2014-2018 mid-infrared light curves of the
object for show that the nucleus brightened by one magnitude at 3.4 microns
and 1.4 magnitudes at 4.6 microns between January 2017 and July 2018 (Cutry
et al., ATel #11913). In the past the object spent much time in a low-luminosity
state where the broad permitted lines were nearly undetectable (Alloin
et al. 1986, ApJ 308, 23). It had several recurrent brightening events
when its type changed from Sy 1.9-Sy 1.8 to Sy 1.5-Sy 1.2 states (Phillips
et al. 1992, ApJ 308, 23). 

Our MASTER data include old unfiltered archival data from 2014, new special
intensive monitoring in the B,V bands, as well as unfiltered W band data
starting in the beginning of July 2018. We show the light curve (<a href=""http://viktorok.ru/NGC1566/lc-1566.jpg"">here</a>)
for unfiltered data reduced to the V-band system of ASAS-SN. As it is seen
from the light curve, our magnitudes are in a good agreement with the ASAS-SN
V-band light curve for 2014-2018. From our data a slow linear decline after
the maximum at the beginning of July is clearly seen. The brightening in
the beginning of ASAS-SN light curve in 2014-2015 is due to a supernova
(SN), but is not seen in our data as our aperture excluded the SN. Analysis
of the Swift/XRT data demonstrates a substantial increase of flux by 1.5
orders of magnitude accompanying the brightening in the UV and optical
bands  
(<a href=""http://viktorok.ru/NGC1566/xrt1566.jpg"">here</a>). 

Low resolution optical spectra were obtained on 2 August 2018 with the
SAAO 1.9-m telescope.  The spectra reveal a dramatic strengthening of the
broad emission lines compared to past published ones. This confirms NGC
1566 to be a changing look Seyfert galaxy. Furthermore: 

1. H-beta is quite a lot brighter than [OIII]5007A. The H-beta to N1 line
ratio is about 2-2.5, corresponding to a Sy1.2 classification. H-beta has
not been observed at this strength before in this object. 
2. The HeII4686A is bright and broad. No such strong HeII was visible in
the past published spectra (see e.g. Kriss et al., 1991, ApJ 377, L13;
Winkler 1992, MNRAS 257, 677). 
3. The [FeX]6374A coronal emission line is stronger than [OI]6300A, something
that has not been seen before in NGC 1566. 

We are going to present more details in our next publications.

The unusual variable DDE 158 = GALEX J140934.6-384610 is going into outburst
on the images obtained with T17 instrument (0.43-m f/6.8 reflector + CCD)
of iTelescope.Net observatory in Siding Spring, Australia. The recent magnitudes
(unfiltered with V zero point) are listed in Table below.

Color-combined DSS finder chart of DDE 158 is uploaded to http://scan.sai.msu.ru/~denis/DDE158-JRIR.jpg
(10'x10' FOV). The star USNO-A2.0 0450-16997190 (14 09 37.93 -38 46 50.3)
located 56 arcsec SE of the variable was used as a reference star with
V=15.269 (APASS DR9, Henden et al., 2016). Light curve of DDE 158 obtained
with the same T17 telescope starting from June 2018 is shown at http://scan.sai.msu.ru/~denis/DDE158-T17-2018Jun01-Aug05.gif

This object was discovered with the tip of the pen based on its unprecedented
(NUV-W1) color index of 8.9 (see Denisenko and Larin, 2018, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04574"">arXiv:1807.04574</a>).
The position of DDE 158 on the color-color diagram of cataclysmic variables
(NUV-W1) vs (W1-W2) is shown at http://scan.sai.msu.ru/~denis/DDE158-CVs-NUV-W1-W2.gif
with the dark blue triangle. (FUV-NUV) value is 0.28. At the distance of
103+/-1 parsec (Gaia DR2) DDE 158 is in Top 20 nearby cataclysmic variables
ranked 16th. With the absolute magnitude M=11.1 at quiescence and M=10.3
in outburst is was categorized as ""micronova"" because of a small outburst
amplitude compared to dwarf novae. This subtype of compact binary systems
has obviously a low accretion rate. T. Maccarone in Cataclysmic Variables
discussion group has suggested that DDE 158 and Larin 2 are objects with
the wind-fed accretion where wind circularization radius is smaller than
the Roche Lobe overflow circularization radius. The tomography of spectral
lines is required to verify whether the accretion disk is present before,
during and after the outburst. Since the orbital period is unknown, the
time-resolved photometry is also strongly encouraged. Based on the outburst
recurrence time from the long-term light curves, the next chance to study
this object will occur no earlier than in spring 2019. 

Another thing to note is the light curve behavior of DDE 158 before the
current outburst. One can detect the ""pumping-up"" phenomenon similar to
that observed during the supercycle of ER UMa-type variables. Every next
outburst in the cycle has a larger amplitude and a longer duration than
the previous one (16.4m on June 11, 16.3 on June 25, 16.2 on July 14).
The dip before the current outburst is clearly detected, even despite the
gap in observations on July 27-31 due to bad weather in Australia. Continued
monitoring of this unusual object from other longitudes is strongly recommended.

During the ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, <a
href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/%61bs/2014ApJ...788...48S"">Shappee et al.
2014</a>), using data from the quadruple 14-cm ""Paczynski"" telescope in
Cerro Tololo, Chile, we discovered a new transient source, most likely
a supernova, in the galaxy 2MASS J22103576-2714557. 

ASASSN-18qk (AT 2018emt)  was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-08-01.13
at g~16.8 mag. We do not detect (g>17.1) the object in images taken on
UT 2018-07-26.86 and before. An image obtained on 2018-08-01 confirms the
discovery of the transient. This <a href=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/assassin/followup/asassn-18qk.png>figure</a>
shows the archival DSS image of the host (left) and the confirmation image
(right). The red circle has a radius of 5"" and is centered on the position
of the transient in the confirmation image. 

The position of ASASSN-18qk is approximately 2.7"" South and 1.8"" West from
the center of the galaxy 2MASS J22103576-2714557 (z=0.023950, d=96 Mpc,
via NED), giving an absolute g-band magnitude of approximately -18.2 (m-M=34.91,
A_g=0.082). The transient lies within the Camera 1 field of the ongoing
<a href=""https://tess.mit.edu/science/tess-pointing/"">TESS Sector 1 observations</a>.

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient.

ATEL #11913,Infra-Red,"
NEOWISE (Mainzer et al. 2014, ApJ, 792, 30) has observed the Seyfert 1.5
galaxy NGC 1566 every six months beginning in January 2014. During each
measurement epoch, NEOWISE acquired 30 to 47 separate 7.7 sec exposures

covering the object over the span of three to five days. The mid-infrared
light curves 
(http://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/roc/ngc1566/ngc1566_lcurve.pdf) of the
object show that the nucleus brightened by one magnitude at 3.4 microns
and 1.4 magnitudes at 4.6 microns between January 2017 and July 2018. 

Elevated levels of X-ray emission from the nucleus of NGC 1566 were reported
in June 2018 (ATel #11754, #11783). 
An ASAS-SN V-band light curve (ATel #11893) shows the nuclear outburst
began to be visible in September 2017. 
The rise in the mid-infrared flux between July 2017 and January 2018 is
consistent with the better-sampled V-band 
light curve. The amplitude of the outburst in the mid-infrared is considerably
larger than in the V-band, but that may  
be a result of less dilution by stellar emission at the longer wavelengths.

The mid-infrared light curves also show evidence for small amplitude variations
prior to the start of the outburst, with 
maxima on or before January 2014 and between January and July 2016. The
8.25 arcsec radius aperture mid-infrared 
measurements do not appear to be influenced by supernova ASASSN-14ha (ATel
#6460, #6461, #6480; Valenti et al. 
2016, MNRAS, 459, 3939) in September 2014 that was just outside of the
measurement aperture. However, the 
supernova is detected in a difference image formed by subtracting NEOWISE
January 2014 data from January 2015 
data. 

The NEOWISE light curves of the nucleus are based on fluxes measured in
an 8.25 arcsec radius aperture relative  
to a sky reference brightness measured in an annular region with inner
and outer radii of 50 and 70 arcsec, respectively. Measurements from exposures
that may be corrupted by image smearing caused by spacecraft jitter are
excluded.

Science Division of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

The known dwarf nova V392 Per underwent its first detected classical nova
eruption on or shortly before 2018 April 29 (<a href=""http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/unconf/followups/J04432130+4721280.html"">CBAT</a>).
Subsequently, the eruption has been followed extensively in the optical
from the ground (see ATel #11588, #11590, #11594, #11601, #11605, #11617,
#11647, #11846 and #11872, <a href=""http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras_DataBase/Novae/2018_NovaPer2018.htm"">ARAS</a>,

Here we report on the initial few observations by the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory following the exit of V392 Per from the Swift Sun-constraint
on 2018 July 20. 

The Swift UVOT photometry obtained on July 20, July 26, and during two

The large flux deficit through the Swift UVOT uvm2 filter suggests a high
extinction toward the system. 

During the 1.6 ks observation on Jul 20y, the Swift XRT recorded a count
rate of 0.060 &plusmn; 0.006 count/sec. The X-ray spectrum could be fitted
with a single temperature optically thin component, with very little column
(N<sub>H</sub>): kT = 2.8 +3.1/-0.8 keV and N<sub>H</sub> < 7&times;10<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>.
However, adding a soft component does improve the fit at the ~99% confidence
level, which gives: APEC kT = 0.53 +0.23/-0.14 keV, atmosphere kT > 42
eV and a much higher N<sub>H</sub> of (3.0 &plusmn; 0.5)&times;10<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>.
Alternatively, a similar fit could be obtained with 2 APEC components.

Eleven ksec of Swift XRT data were obtained across 2018 July 26 and 27.
With the additional statistics from this longer exposure time, the spectrum
is better fitted with three temperature components: either three APECs
or two APECs and a soft model atmosphere component. Given that we might
expect super-soft source emission to be modelled with an atmosphere component,
we present this fit here: 

APEC kT1 = 0.29 +0.10/-0.07 keV; APEC kT2 > 13 keV; atmosphere kT < 57
eV; N<sub>H</sub> = (1.9 &plusmn; 0.3)&times;10<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;cm<sup>-2<sup>.

Swift will continue to observe the eruption with an approximately weekly
cadence. 

We thank the Swift PI, Brad Cenko, for approving the observations, and
the Swift planning and operations teams for their ongoing support.

ATEL #11907,X-ray,"
The MAXI/GSC nova alert system triggered on a bright X-ray source at 22:05
UT on 2018 August 2. The spectrum of this scan transit was well reproduced
by an absorbed blackbody model with a temperature of kT = 1.9 (+0.4, -0.3)
keV (90% CL) and the hydrogen column density was 4.8 (-4.3, 7.2)x 10<sup>22</sup>
cm<sup>-2</sup> (90% CL). The averaged X-ray flux in 2 - 10 keV band was
8.6(-1.4,+1.3) x 10<sup>-9</sup>ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (90% CL). On the
basis of the fitting results, this transient is probably a type-I X-ray
burst.

Since the emission was detected only for a fraction of the triangular 
transit response, the uncertainty of its position along the scan direction

is large.  Without assuming the source constancy, we obtain a rectangular

error box (90%C.L.) with the following corners:

(R.A., Dec) = (259.522, -39.888) deg = (17 18 05, -39 53 15) (J2000)

(R.A., Dec) = (259.363, -39.845) deg = (17 17 27, -39 50 40) (J2000)

(R.A., Dec) = (259.378, -42.084) deg = (17 17 30, -42 05 00) (J2000)

(R.A., Dec) = (259.543, -42.127) deg = (17 18 10, -42 07 35) (J2000).

The source was not detected significantly in the previous transit at 8/2
20:40 and in the next transit at 8/2 23:44 UT with an upper limit of 20
mCrab for each.

Since LMXB RX J1718.4-4029 located in the error region of the transient,
we suggest that the transient is a type-I X-ray burst from RX J1718.4-4029
or a new source (we tentatively name the source MAXI J1718-409).

ATEL #11906,Radio,"		Observations, AGN, Quasar, Transient

We report discovery of an X-ray transient in recent (2018 July 26, 31)
Chandra observations targeting the James Webb Space Telescope North Ecliptic
Pole Time Domain Field (JWST NEP-TDF).

JWST NEP-TDF is a JWST Guaranteed Time Observer program (PI: Windhorst)
with multi-epoch visits planned promptly after JWST launch (Jansen & Windhorst,
arXiv:1807.05278). NEP-TDF has exceptional advantages for time domain science
and early universe science with JWST due to its low IR background, lack
of IR-bright interlopers, and location in the JWST continuous viewing zone.
We are in the process of developing a deep multi-wavelength dataset to
complement future observations and set a baseline for post-launch time
domain science.  

To date, three ~50-ks epochs of the associated 900-ks multi-cycle Chandra
campaign have been observed. The source was marginally detected (~13 net
0.3-8 keV counts; SNR~2.3) over 2018 April 11-13 (obsids 21072, 21073,
20363). On 2018 July 26, we detected the source at SNR~9.5, with an increase
in count rate by a factor of ~7 (neglecting modest corrections due to changes
in vignetting and PSF). By 2018 July 31, the count rate had decayed by
~25% (variability SNR~2.3).  Spectral fits of both July detections are
consistent with an absorbed power law (nH~2e22/cm^2, Gamma~2, ~4e-14 cgs
flux (0.3-8 keV)). 

The location (RA, Dec)=(17:24:21.72, +65:48:47.3) is consistent with SDSS
J172421.74+654847.5 (ugriz=[20.89,20.73,20.45,20.28,20.58]). Pre-flare
GALEX and SDSS photometry (Richards et al, 2009, ApJS, 180, 67) indicate
that the SDSS counterpart is likely a quasar at z~1.1 (1.0-1.6) but UV/O/IR
host spectroscopy is currently unavailable. This interpretation is consistent
with WISE W1,2,3 colors.  For a flare at z~1.1, the X-ray luminosity is
Lx~3e44 erg/s and we infer Lbol>10^45 erg/s based on pre-flare photometry.
A redshift of z~1.44 is permitted and would place the source at a mere
~3.5 Mpc from NLSy1/FSRQ VCS5 J172314.1+654746, near the center of the
field.  Subaru HEROES giz photometry (PI: Hasinger) from 2017 July indicates
brightening by (0.54,0.23,0.67) over SDSS magnitudes. No radio source is
evident from our deep (rms~micro-Jy) pre-flare 3GHz VLA data. 

This flare is strong for an AGN, and could indicate an accretion state
change (e.g. a changing look quasar). A z>1 changing look quasar would
be exceptional for its distance, would constrain the X-ray flare onset
to <50 days (rest-frame), and would permit monitoring of several rest-frame
UV transitions from the ground.  At 10' from the NEP-TDF center, it is
outside the planned JWST GTO program (r~NIRCAM<7', r~NIRISS<5') but would
be well-situated for JWST GO observations with pure parallels that deepen
or expand the GTO field. 

We are planning multi-wavelength follow-up observations and encourage additional
follow-up. O/IR spectroscopy is particularly needed to confirm the redshift
and nature of the optical counterpart, and in anticipation of continued
monitoring. Given the pre-flare SDSS magnitudes, such follow-up should
be possible from a wide variety of telescopes.

We report on follow-up Swift observations of the nearby Seyfert 1.5 galaxy
NGC 1566 (Dai et al., ATel #11893) which was discovered in an outburst
in hard X-rays by Integral on 2018-June-12-19 (Ducci et al., ATel #11754).
Swift observations immediately after this discovery showed that the X-ray
flux in the XRT had significantly increased (Ferrigno et al., ATel #11783)
as well as in the UV (Kuin et al., ATel #11786). The most recent Swift
observations from July 10, 17, 24, and 31 confirm the high X-ray and UV
flux states, but may indicate that the peak of the outburst was reached
around July 10. The current flux in the 0.3-10 keV band is (6.79+/-0.19)e-14
W/m2 which corresponds to a 0.3-10 keV luminosity of 3e35 W assuming a
distance of 20 Mpc. The enhanced X-ray position (Goad et al. 2007; Evans
et al. 2009) at RA-2000 = 04 20 00.37, Dec-2000=-54 56 16.6 (uncertainty
1.4"") corresponds to the optical position of the center of the galaxy.

Our Swift UVOT observation on 2018-July-31 was performed in the filters
V, B, U, W1, and W2. Compared with the 2007 observation we found the following
magnitudes: 
V: 13.49, 13.01 (2007, 2018); B: 14.40, 13.40; U: 14.18, 12.59; W1: 14.50,
12.48; W2: 15.09, 12.60 (note that the extraction radius was 5 arcsec,
and that the host galaxy significantly contributes to the magnitudes at
low-state). The W2 magnitude is slightly lower than that reported by Kuin
et al. (ATel #11786). The uncertainties of all these observations are typically
of the order of 0.04 mag and the values given here are not corrected for
Galactic reddening. The reddening however in the direction of NGC 1566
is low with E(B-V) = 0.008 mag.     

We would like to thank Brad Cenko for approving our ToO request and the
Swift team for performing the observations. We continue monitoring this
AGN with Swift.

We observed again the optical afterglow of the bright, low-redshift GRB
180728A (Starling et al., GCN 23046; Lipunov et al., GCB 23048; Rossi et
al., GCB 23055) with the ESO VLT UT2 equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph.
Observations were carried out around July 30.21 UT (35.5 hr after the GRB).

In our observations, the afterglow has faded significantly compared to
our previous observation (Rossi et al., GCN 23055), reaching a magnitude
of R ~ 20 (Vega). Continuum is detected across the whole observed range
3000-25000 AA, despite at lower S/N. Weak emission lines from a faint host
are now visible, corresponding to H&alpha;, H&beta;, [N II], [O III] 5008
at the GRB redshift. The small Balmer decrement is consistent with negligible
dust extinction in the host galaxy. 

After excluding the host emission lines and correcting for Galactic extinction,
the observed continuum can be fit with a single power-law with spectral
index ~ 0.6 (F_nu~nu^-beta). In particular, we do not see evidence in any
of our spectra for broad undulations or deviations from a power-law behavior
as reported by Buckley et al. (ATel 11897). 
A figure showing our spectrum can be seen at:

We are regularly collecting spectra and BVRI photometry of MAXI 1820+070

with the Asiago 1.22m, 1.82m and Schmidt 67/92 telescopes, and ANS 
Collaboration telescope ID 2300.  These observations are performed in 
coordination with optical timing observations carried out by the 
AQUEYE+IQUEYE Collaboration (ATel #11723, #11824).  MAXI 1820+070 is a

bright and uncatalogued X-ray transient source first detected on 2018 March

11 by Kawamuro et al.  (ATel #11399) and then identified with the optical

transient ASASSN-18ey (ATel #11400, #11403, #11404, #11406).  The source
was 
soon proposed to be a candidate black hole X-ray binary by Baglio et al.

(ATel #11418).  A massive multi-wavelength observational effort is currently

underway worldwide as indicated by the large number of ATel issued on this

source so far.  The source recently underwent a hard to soft accretion
state 
transition (ATel #11820, #11823, #11827, #11831, #11833, #11855, #11887).

Here we describe the detection of changes in recent optical spectra of
MAXI 
1820+070 taken after the reported hard to soft accretion state transition.

The observations have been obtained with the Asiago 1.22m telescope, at
2.31 
Ang/pix dispersion over the 3300-8000 Ang range.  The most recent observing

dates have been centered on UT July 19.872, 23.883, 25.915, 27.878, 29.863

and 30.886.  On all these dates the spectra are similar, with a strong
blue 
continuum and superimposed broad emission lines (with an average FWHM of

1100 km/s) of - primarily - the Balmer series of hydrogen, HeII 4686 and

5412 Ang, various HeI, and the 4640 complex by NIII.  On July 19 and 23

spectra, the Balmer emission lines appear single peaked and broadly Gaussian

in shape.  On July 25 the Balmer lines begin to show a hint of a double

peaked profile, that matures into two components separated by about 850
km/s 
on July 27, and retrace back to just a double peaked profile by July 29,
and 
finally to a single component by July 30.  HeI and HeII lines show 
equivalent transitions between single/double profiles, apparently not in

phase with those displayed by Balmer lines but with a similar velocity

separation. We plan to continue the high cadence spectroscopic monitoring

of MAXI 1820+070 and associated photometric and optical timing 
observations.

We obtained 22-GHz VLBI observations of AT2018cow with the NRAO VLBA and
Effelsberg telescopes.  The midpoint of the observations was 2018 July
8.1 UT.  We detect the source with a total flux density of 
~5 mJy.  We obtain a preliminary position of RA = 16h 16m 00.2242s, dec
= 22d 16' 04.890"" with an estimated uncertainty of 60 micro-arcsec.  Our
position is more accurate than the previously reported one from e-MERLIN
(Atel #11819) but only 3.2 milliarcsecond different, and therefore consistent
within the estimated uncertainties. 

The position is based that of the phase-reference source, JVAS J1619+2247.

The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME; www.chime-experiment.ca)
is a transit radio telescope consisting of four 20m x 100m cylindrical
reflectors oriented North/South, plus a powerful F-X correlator, located
at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory near Penticton, British
Columbia, Canada. The CHIME Fast Radio Burst (FRB) Project (CHIME/FRB Collaboration,
ApJ, in press, arXiv:1803.11235) forms 1024 independent stationary intensity
beams with 1-ms time sampling and 16k frequency channels over a range of
400 - 800 MHz. CHIME/FRB is a uniquely fast survey instrument that can
search for FRBs over an instantaneous field of view of ~200 square degrees
in real time. 

During its ongoing commissioning CHIME/FRB detected FRB 180725A on 2018
July 25 at 17:59:43.115 UTC (topocentric, at 400 MHz). The automated pipeline
triggered the recording to disk of ~20 seconds of buffered raw intensity
data around the time of the FRB. The event had an approximate width of
2 ms and was found at dispersion measure 716.6 pc/cm^3 with a signal-to-noise
ratio S/N ~20.6 in one beam and 19.4 in a neighbouring beam. The centres
of these, approximately 0.5 deg wide and circular beams, were at RA, Dec
= (06:13:54.7, +67:04:00.1; J2000) and RA, Dec = (06:12:53.1, +67:03:59.1;
J2000). However, precise localisation of the source and a flux estimate
await further commissioning and calibration. The expected maximum Galactic
line-of-sight dispersion measure in the source's direction is 69 pc/cm^3
(from the NE2001 model)  or 81 pc/cm^3 (from the YMW16 model). The observed
DM is far in excess of these values, even after accounting for the systematic
uncertainties in the Galactic-DM models, confirming the identification
of this event as an FRB. The event is clearly detected at frequencies as
low as 580 MHz and represents the first detection of an FRB at radio frequencies
below 700 MHz. 

The de-dispersed frequency versus time plots for both beams can be found
at the link below. Some frequency channels with terrestrial radio frequency
interference have been zero-weighted.  We do not find compelling evidence
of scattering in the burst profile, and we caution against over-interpreting
the band-limited structure of the pulse spectrum, as the data have not
been corrected for frequency-dependent beam sensitivity.  Further observations
to search for repeated bursts at all wavelengths are encouraged.

Additional FRBs have been found since FRB 180725A and some have flux at
frequencies as low as 400 MHz. These events have occurred during both the
day and night and their arrival times are not correlated with known on-site
activities or other known sources of terrestrial RFI.

We observed the field of SN2018EBT (ATel #11891, TNS Report No. 20792)
with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array(AMI-LA; Zwart et al.
2008; Hickish et al. 2018) at 15.5 GHz on 2018-07-24.92 for 4 hours. 

We do not detect a source at the phase center, and we set a 3-sigma upper
limit of ~110 uJy. 

The custom pipeline REDUCE_DC (e.g. Perrott et al. 2015) was used to calibrate
and flag the data, with 3C286 as the absolute flux calibrator and J2022-6136
as the interleaved phase calibrator. 

We plan to continue monitoring this source and would like to thank the
MRAO staff for carrying out these observations.

ATEL #11897,Optical,"
We report on SALT spectroscopy of the optical counterpart to GRB180728A,
which was discovered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Starling et
al., GCN#23046) and for which an optical transient was detected by the
MASTER-SAAO transient detection facility (Lipunov et al., GCN#23048, GCN#23050)
and spectra obtained by the ESO VLT UT2 using X-Shooter (Rossi et al.,
GCN#23055). 

A 1600 s exposure spectrum was obtained with the SALT Robert Stobie Spectrograph
(RSS) on 2018 July 28 at 21:43:21 UT (mid exposure time) using the 300
l/mm grating covering 3900-9000&#8491; at an average resolving power of
R = 350.   

We attempted a spectroscopic classification with the SNID code (Blondin
& Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), with the best match being a SN Type  Ic,
five days before maximum, at a redshift of z=0.042, although the match
is quite poor. While the major humps in the continuum occur close to their
predicted wavelengths, there are significant flux residuals. We clearly
detect both the rest frame interstellar Ca II 3933/3970&#8491; and Na I
5890/5896&#8491 doublets.  Two absorption features seen at 4393 & 4434&#8491;
are identified as the Ca II doublet at a redshift of z = 0.117, consistent
with the determination of Rossi et al.(GCN#23055).     

Simultaneous optical photometry with the SAAO 1-m telescope using the high-speed
SHOC EM-CCD camera in white-light showed GRB180728A to only slowly fade
over the period 00:46 to 02:47 UT, by approximately half a magnitude.

MASTER OT J165415.75-540239.27 -  SOS  emission of the GRB 180728A

MASTER-SAAO robotic telescope (MASTER-Net: http://observ.pereplet.ru, 

Lipunov et al., 2010, Advances in Astronomy, vol. 2010, 30L) located in

South Africa (South African Astronomical Observatory) was pointed to the

GRB180728A (Starling et al., GCN #23046; Perri et al., GCN #23049;) 22
sec after notice time and 38 sec after trigger time at  
2018-07-28 17:29:38 UT in two polarizations. On our first (10s exposure)

set we  found  new optical object (transient) within SWIFT XRT error-box

(Lipunov et al., GCN Circ #23048; Lipunov et al., GCN Circ #23050) : 

MASTER OT J165415.75 -540239.27 

RA, DEC = 16h 54m 15.75s , -54d 02m 39.27s 

m ~ 14.5 at maximum; error = 1 arcsec;

We see a gradual attenuation of the OT on an automatic light  
curve. Thus, the transient is an optical counterpart of the gamma-ray 

burst GRB 180728A. 

The automatic light curve is available at

1566</a> started to brighten significantly around September 2017, and 
it is currently the brightest it has ever been in our data.  The light

curve shown was obtained using ASAS-SN Sky Patrol (Kochanek et 
al. 2017, PASP, 129, 4502), which employs fixed aperture photometry, 
and therefore contains significant light contamination from the host 
galaxy. The ""bump"" visible in 2014 is due to Type II supernova 
ASASSN-14ha in that galaxy, further underscoring the dramatic nature 
of the present brightening episode.

The AGN inside NGC 1566 has been reported to have enhanced activity based

on Integral and Swift observations from June 2018 (ATel #11786, 
#11783, #11754.)

Multi-wavelength follow-up observations are encouraged. 

We thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their continued 
support of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon and Betty 
Moore Foundation through grant GBMF5490 to the Ohio State University, 
NSF grant AST-1515927, the Mt. Cuba Astronomical Foundation, the

(5) It shows narrow Balmer lines and blue continuum. 
(6) Orphan transient. 
(7) Best fit templates are of SNe Ia at z~0.027 at one week past maximum,
however we measured a redshift of 0.034, 
from the host galaxy narrow emission lines. ASAS-SN reported V = 16.50
mag on 2018-07-21 and g=17.3 mag on 2018-07-22, 
suggesting an intrinsic red colour or a fast decline in the SN brightness.
The classification spectrum does not look 
peculiarly red, suggesting a fast photometric evolution rather than red
colours. We encourage photometric follow-up.  
(8) The best template fit is SN1993J (IIb) at -17.

were done with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). Redshifts
are derived from the broad SN features (two decimal points), and from narrow
SN features or host galaxy lines (three decimal points). Limits prior to

Within the IBIS positional uncertainty one bright and hard X-ray source
was detected (Landi et al. 2012, ATel #4233) but no unambiguous optical
counterpart was found. 

Chandra pointed at the region of this source on 2017-05-20, with an exposure
time of 5 ks (Obs. Id. 18975) and was able to locate the source (RA(J2000)=16:18:07.73,
Dec(J2000)=-54:06:12.14) with  an uncertainty of only 2 arcsec, allowing
us to pinpoint a single optical/IR object: USNO-B1.0 0358-0591923/2MASSJ
16180771-5406122, also listed in the ALL-WISE catalogue with colours W1-W2=1.176
and W2-W3=2.566, i.e. typical of AGNs (Secrest et al. 2015, ApJS, 221,
12). The source spectrum is absorbed (N<sub>H</sub>~10<sup>23</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>)
and bright (0.3-10 keV flux=3x10<sup>-12</sup> ergs cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>).

This source was also observed by NuSTAR on 2017-01-29 (Obs. Id. 30161006002),
with a net exposure time of 59 ks, as part of the Galactic Legacy Survey.
The NuSTAR spectrum is well fitted by an absorbed power law (Chi^2/dof=192/171),
with positive residuals around 6 keV suggesting the presence of a Fe K
alpha emission line. Adding a narrow Gaussian line improves the fit (Delta
Chi^2 of -15 for 2 dof less; the probability of chance improvement is 0.001
from an F-test). The equivalent width of the line is 100+/-50 eV, and its
energy (observer's frame) is 5.85+\-0.15 keV. If interpreted as the neutral
Fe K alpha line at 6.4 keV, it would indicate a redshift of 0.085+/-0.015.
Finally, we measure a photon index Gamma=1.69+/-0.08 and an absorbing column
density of (8+/-2)x10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> . The extrapolated 0.3-10
keV flux is 4x10<sup>-12</sup> ergs cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, while
the extrapolated 20-100 keV flux is 1.2x10<sup>-11</sup> ergs cm<sup>-2</sup>
s<sup>-1</sup> (a factor of 1.5 larger than the IBIS flux).  

We encourage multiwavelength observations of this source to confirm its
extragalactic nature.

ATEL #11891,Optical,"
The Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) Unbiased Transient Survey (NUTS; ATel
#8992) reports the spectroscopic classification of ATLAS18sld/SN 2018ebt.
The candidate was discovered by ATLAS (Atel #11727) on UT 2018-07-21 11:52:48
at 15.58 mag (orange-ATLAS).  

The spectroscopic observation was performed with the 2.56 m Nordic Optical
Telescope 
equipped with ALFOSC (range 350-950 nm; resolution 1.6 nm FWHM).  

Survey Name   | IAU Name    | Discovery (UT)   | Discovery mag  | Observation
(UT)         | Redshift          | Type           | Phase             
ATLAS18sld    | SN 2018ebt  | 2018-07-21.50    | 15.58          | 2018-07-24.06
| <~0.02-0.03       | likely Ic-BL.  | pre-/near peak 

Classification was performed using the SNID (Blondin and Tonry 
2007, ApJ, 666, 1024)  and GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488, 
383) tools. The closest matches are SNe Ic-BL (e.g., 2012ap, 2006aj) 
with phases at a few days before the peak or around the peak, and the 
redshifts from these matches are uncertain, generally between 0.02 - 
0.03 or less. There are also some matches with other SNe Ib/Ic. The 
most recent ATLAS observation (15.20 +/- 0.04 mag at MJD = 58324.50) 
shows that the SN is brighter than at discovery, and the light curve 
indicates that it might be approaching the peak, which is consistent 
with the estimated spectroscopic phase based on SNID/GELATO. At z ~ 
0.02 - 0.03, the latest ATLAS measurement would indicate an absolute 
magnitude M_o ~ -20 - -21 (assuming that Galactic extinction A_o is similar

to A_R = 0.6 from NED), while the redshift could be lower and then the

object would be less luminous. Note that ATLAS18sld/SN 2018ebt was 
classified by Masayuki Yamanaka as a SN Ib/c at z=0.005 using the 
spectrum taken by 1.5-m Kanata telescope/HOWPol on UT 2018-07-23 
13:47:51. 

Spectral lines from the host galaxy will be needed to pin down the 
SN redshift/distance and its absolute magnitude. ATLAS18sld/SN 2018ebt

is about 14'' away from the center of a faint galaxy GALEXASC 
J204152.80+641238.5 (unknown redshift). Given the apparent magnitude of
the host (r=17.0 from PanSTARRS), and taking the largest plausible value
for the distance (z=0.03), the host galaxy is likely fainter than r~-19.1.
The relatively large 
separation from the center of its probable may indicate a low-metallicity
environment. 

Further follow-up observations are encouraged.

ATEL #11887,Radio,"
Following reports of rapid X-ray spectral softening and a hard-to-soft
state transition (e.g. ATels #11820, #11823), we observed MAXI J1820+070
/ ASASSN-18ey (e.g. ATels #11399, #11400, #11418, #11420) with the Low-Frequency
Array (LOFAR) on 2018 July 7, 10, 11 and 13. Each observation was 48 min
in duration, centred at or near transit, preceded by a 10-min scan of the
calibrator 3C295. The MJDs corresponding to the on-source times for the
target are 58306.935-58306.969, 58309.927-58309.961, 58310.935-58310.968
and 58312.935-58312.968.  

Similar to our previous LOFAR observation and detection of this source
(ATel #11609), these high-band (115-189 MHz) observations were reduced
with the Prefactor calibration pipeline (e.g. van Weeren et al. 2016, ApJS,
223, 2). A very preliminary reduction with a restricted bandwidth (115-158
MHz) yielded an average angular resolution of about 38"" x 22"" (average
beam position angle 10 deg east of north), and RMS noise levels between
2.4 and 4.9 mJy/beam. MAXI J1820+070 / ASASSN-18ey is detected at the 5.5
sigma level in our first observation, but more marginally in the remaining
runs (flux density of peak pixel = 3.0-4.8 x RMS). The flux densities of
the target at a central frequency of 136.5 MHz are 27.1 +/- 5.6, 12.0 +/-
3.0, 11.5 +/- 2.7 and 14.7 +/- 5.1 mJy on July 7, 10, 11 and 13, respectively.
In all cases, the quoted flux density is that of the peak pixel; uncertainties
were calculated by combining the RMS and a 10 per cent calibration error
in quadrature. The flux density scale is that of Scaife & Heald 2012 (MNRAS,
423, L30). Further direction-dependent calibration is planned, which will
reduce the noise level. 

A 15.5-GHz Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA) observation
of this source was taken at the same time as our July 7 observation (ATel
#11827), with a flux density of approximately 1.5 mJy. The instantaneous
two-point spectral index, alpha, between 136.5 MHz and 15.5 GHz (flux density
S<sub>nu</sub> proportional to nu<sup>alpha</sup>) is therefore approximately
-0.6 for MJD 58306.935-58306.969, consistent with optically thin synchrotron
emission. This spectral index, as well as our low-frequency light curve,
suggests that we are observing the decay of the radio flare seen on July
6/7 (ATel #11827), which followed jet quenching on July 5/6 (ATels #11827,
#11831; also see ATel #11833). 

A further LOFAR observation took place on July 20 (MJD 58319.900-58319.933),
which is still to be reduced at the time of writing, and our final run
is scheduled to take place on July 27 (MJD 58326), again centred at or
near transit.  

We thank the ASTRON Radio Observatory, particularly Roberto Pizzo and Matthijs
van der Wiel, for promptly scheduling our LOFAR observations and pre-processing
the data.

Nucita et al. (ATel #11882) reported that the light curve of the microlensing
event <a href=""http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/unconf/followups/J18010186-2951258.html"">TCP
J18010186-2951258</a> (ATel #11853) shows deviations from the single lens
model that could be interpreted as a signature of the binary lens with
the mass ratio q = 8.3e-3. 
<p/> 
This event is located in the field BLG513 that is regularly monitored by
the <a href=""http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/"">OGLE-IV Survey</a>. The archival
22-year-long light curve of the source reveals semi-regular low-amplitude
variability that is typical of OGLE small amplitude red giants. The strongest
pulsation period is 155.4 d, but the light curve shows additional modulation
on timescales of 10-20 d. Although the amplitude of variability in the
baseline is small (0.03 mag or 3% of the flux in the I band), it is magnified
by a factor ~30 during the microlensing event. 
<p/> 
Deviations from the single lens model in the light curve of TCP J18010186-2951258
are likely caused by the variability of the source star, not by the binarity
of the lens.

ATEL #11884,X-ray,"
During the recently recommenced Galactic Plane Scan program (PI: Dr A.
Bazzano), the IBIS/ISGRI instruments onboard the INTEGRAL observatory observed
a clear re-brightening of MAXI J1535-571, a bright black hole candidate
in a low-mass X-ray binary (Y Xu et al. 2012 ApJ, 852, 2). MAXI J1535-571
was first detected by Swift and MAXI in outburst in early September 2017
(GCN #21792, ATel #10699) where it reached ~5 Crab in the MAXI/GSC band,
making it one of the brightest black hole binary candidates observed. 

The source was detected by IBIS/ISGRI during scans performed early in revolution
1979 (between 2018-07-22 00:28:13 and 2018-07-23 11:11:35) and was observed
to be brightening strongly. 

In the analysis of the stacked data from the revolution, IBIS/ISGRI data
detected the source at RA = 233.851, Dec = -57.240, 3' error radius, and
with an overall detection significance in the 22-60 keV band of 8.6 sigma.
The flux was measured in the 22-60 keV as 1.72 +/- 0.2^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1
(15.89 +/- 1.84 mCrab), with an effective exposure time of 5.2 ks. 

Further Galactic Plane Scan observations are due in the coming days and
we will continue to monitor this source. Other observations to observe
the developing outburst in all wavelengths are strongly encouraged.

ATEL #11886,Gamma Ray,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed enhanced gamma-ray emission from a source
positionally consistent with the Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) CGRaBS
J1933+6540, also known as TXS 1933+655, with coordinates R.A. = 293.4889050
deg, Decl. = 65.6713411 deg (J2000; Beasley et al. 2002 ApJS 141, 13),
at redshift, z=1.687 (Healey et al. 2008 ApJS 175, 97). This source is
not in any published LAT catalog and was not detected by AGILE or EGRET.

Preliminary analysis indicates that this source went into a high-flux state
on 2018 July 23, with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (0.6+/-0.1)
x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainties only; single power-law
photon index of 2.3+/-0.2), with a peak 6-hr flux from 12:00-18:00 UTC
of (1.0+/-0.3) x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1.  

Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray
monitoring of this source will continue. We encourage further multifrequency
observations of this source. The Fermi-LAT contact person for this source
is C. C. Cheung (teddy.cheung@nrl.navy.mil). 

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

The transient TCP J18010186-2951258  (at J2000 coordinates RA = 18:01:01.84
Dec=-29:51:23.8)  
was first discovered by T. Kojima on UT 2018 07 13.494 and the ASAS-SN
Sky Patrol light curve  
(Shappee et al. 2014; Kochanek et al. 2017) resembles that of a  
microlensing event (Subo Dong et al. ATel #11853). 
By inspecting the ASAS-SN data around the peak we noticed an anomaly  
with respect to the Paczinsky best fit profile. Hence, including all currently
(and free) archival  
V band data (AAVSO, and ASAS-SN) together with a few newly remotely  acquired
data using iTelescope.Net instruments (T17)  
n Siding Spring, Australia, (https://www.itelescope.net/)  we find a best
fit solution with a binary  
lens model with parameters q= 8.3E-3, b=0.66, t_0=113.8 (HJD-2458200),
t_E= 19.5 days, u_0=0.027, theta = 2.63 radians, V_0 = 14.5.  

Subsequent analysis on the characteristics of the lens system parameters
and the background source is in progress  
with the aim to test other possible models (including blending and finite
source effects), check the robustness of the solution, confirm  
the binary lens model and, if so, refine the best fit parameters. Detailed
analysis on the possible planetary feature will be presented elsewhere.

This work makes use of ASAS-SN data (Shappee et al. 2014 and Kochanek et
al. 2017). We acknowledge with thanks the  
variable star observations from the AAVSO International Database contributed
by observers worldwide and used in this 
research. The use of the Siding Spring Observatory facilities is also acknowledged.

We also remind that the BVRI band observations at the T17 Siding Spring

on 2018 June 5 (Yoneyama et al., ATEL#11683).  The source quickly made
a transition to a soft or intermediate state (Negoro et al., ATEL#11696).
NICER measurements on June 5th showed a thermal component with kT near
0.2 keV along with a power-law component with a photon index near Gamma
= 2.5 (Ludlam et al., ATEL#11689).  A Swift/XRT measurement on June 7th
(Kennea et al., ATEL#11697) showed a similar photon index but a hotter
thermal component (kT = 0.46+/-0.01 keV).  The highest flux reported was
3.9e-9 erg/cm2/s (0.5-10 keV, absorbed) from the Swift/XRT observation
(ATEL#11697).  Based on an inspection of the MAXI light curve and our analysis
of Swift/XRT observations on June 9, 13, and 16, kT peaked near 0.56+/-0.01
keV, and the 0.5-10 keV absorbed flux peaked near 7.3e-9 erg/cm2/s (based
on the June 13 measurements). 

The Swift/XRT monitoring restarted in mid-July, and observations were made
on July 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22.  The observation on June 16 had no usable
data due to a mispointing of the satellite, but we analyzed the data from
the other four observations.  We modeled the 0.5-10 keV spectra with an
absorbed disk-blackbody plus power-law model.  The column density measurements
ranged from (3.6+/-1.1)e21 atoms/cm2 to (5.2+/-0.6)e21 atoms/cm2.  On July
10, the disk temperature was 0.18+/-0.01 keV, and it was 0.14-0.15 keV
for the other three observations (July 13, 19, and 22).  A gradual hardening
of the power-law photon index is observed:  Gamma = 2.04+/-0.06 (July 10),
Gamma = 1.97+/-0.06 (July 13), Gamma = 1.85+0.07-0.03 (July 19), and Gamma
= 1.75+/-0.08 (July 22).  Over the same time, the 0.5-10 keV absorbed flux
drops from 1.37e-9 erg/cm2/s to 6.1e-10 erg/cm2/s.  The change in the photon
index shows that the source is entering or has entered the hard state.

A NuSTAR TOO has been approved for the coming week and is being scheduled.
It will most likely occur on July 24 or 27.  See http://www.srl.caltech.edu/NuSTAR_Public/NuSTAROperationSite/Schedule.php
for updates on the schedule.  Coordinated observations are encouraged.

We report on high-resolution optical spectroscopy of ASASSN-18pe which
was reported as a possible cataclysmic variable on a slow rise to eruption
by Strader et al. (2018, ATel #11867). 

We obtained a 1200 s spectrum of this object under the SALT Large Science
Program on transients on 2018 July 19.2 (HJD 2458319.2), using the High
Resolution Spectrograph (HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE, 91476) mounted
on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Observations were taken
in the LR mode of HRS, covering a spectral range of 3800-8900 &#8491; at
a resolution of R = 14000. The data were reduced with the SALT HRS MIDAS
pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068). 

The spectrum shows a very blue continuum with a strong He II emission at
4686#8491 characterised by a single emission peak, a FWHM ~ 180 &plusmn;
10 km/s, and a heliocentric corrected Vr ~ 115 &plusmn; 5 km/s. The other
lines of the Pickering series at 4542&#8491 and 5412&#8491 are also present
in emission showing a similar Vr but are much weaker. Halpha also shows
an emission feature characterised by a FWHM ~ 150 &plusmn; 10 km/s and
Vr ~ 95 &plusmn; 5 km/s. The flux ratio of (He II/Halpha) is around 2.3.
Hbeta shows a weak emission feature superimposed on a relatively broad
absorption feature (FWHM ~ 1300 &plusmn; 200 km/s). The emission feature
might be associated with He II at 4859&#8491. Hgamma is also present in
absorption. 

We also identify weak emission lines of He I at 6678&#8491 and 7065&#8491
with Vr ~ 115 km/s and H I at 8598&#8491, 8665&#8491, and 8750&#8491 with
Vr between 160 and 180 km/s. The EW of the Na I D interstellar absorption
doublet is consistent with a relatively low extinction towards the source
(Av ~ 0.2) in fair agreement with the Galactic Extinction maps.  

The unusually strong He II 4686 emission and the photometric behaviour
reported in ATels #11867 and #11875 are worth further investigation.

On 12th Luly 2018 the FSRQ PKS 0035-252 (z=0.498), triggered our HE monitor
of FERMI-LAT data at E > 10 GeV with TS ~49 (see, Pacciani et al. 2014,
ApJ, 790, 45 for a description of the method), showing a power-law gamma-ray
spectrum exceeding 40 GeV in the satellite frame (see also the ATel #11854
by the Fermi-LAT collaboration on 14th July 2018). 
We obtained 3 follow-up observations with Swift starting on 13th July 2018.
The source showed the brightest optical and X-ray flux ever detected with
The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, With a peak flux reached on the last
pointing on 18th July 2018.  
On 16th July 2018, the source was observed twice within 6 hours and showed
a variability of 25% with all optical/nuv filters (2 nearby sources where
used as reference). 
On 18th July 2018 the source was observed for a reduced time, and with
the W2 only filter. The magnitude (Vega system) was: 14.30+-0.02 (stat
error only) and The x-ray flux was (5.+-1)*10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-10
KeV). 

On 16th July 2018, the photometry (Vega sytem) was: 

VV: 14.85 +- 0.03 

UU: 14.61 +- 0.03 

W1: 14.51 +- 0.02 

M2: 14.46 +- 0.02 

W2: 14.59 +- 0.02 

(stat error only). 

The simultaneous Swift-XRT observation gives a counting rate of  cps. 
The X-ray spectrum was fitted with an absorbed power-law, with unabsorbed
flux: (5.4+-+-0.4)10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1, and photon index: 1.30+-0.26 (0.3-10keV).

We have obtained UBVRI photometry (Landolt system) and optical 
spectroscopy of recently discovered ASASSN-18pe currently undergoing a

large amplitude outburst (Atel #11867).  Photometry was obtained on UT
July 
19.888 with the ANS Collaboration telescope 1205 (42cm) providing B=13.961,

V=13.895, R=13.801, and I=13.678, with total error budgets (including 
transformation from the instantaneous local photometric system to the 
reference Landolt equatorial standards) less than 0.01 mag in all bands.
We 
also obtain U=13.27, but with a larger uncertainty considering the sea
level 
altitude of the observing site.  This indicates a continuing (and slow)
rise 
in brightness of ASASSN-18pe, that was reported in Atel #11867 at V=14.3
two 
days earlier.  The overall color seems somewhat bluer that the SLOAN griz

values listed for quiescence in the Pan-STARRS release 1 (PS1) Survey 

Absolute optical spectrophotometry was obtained with the Asiago 1.22m 
telescope at 2.31 Ang/pix over the 3250-7950 Ang range on UT Jul 19.853.

The spectrum rises steeply toward the short wavelengths in agreement with

the blue photometric colors.  Hbeta, gamma, delta, epsilon lines stands
in 
clear absorption although with a minimal equivalent width, H9 being the

highest Hydrogen line before those further up merge into the Balmer 
continuum in absorption.  NaI 5890, 5896 doublet is also in clear 
absorption.  Only an emission component is visible in Halpha with an 
integrated flux of 6.6 (+/- 0.6) x 10(-15) erg/cm2 sec.  The strongest

emission line is HeII 4686, radiating an integrated flux of 1.34 (+/-0.11)
x 
10(-14) erg/cm2 sec, twice larger than Halpha (both lines single peaked).

No evident emission line from HeI is visible, with the possible exception
of 
a feeble 5876 Ang.  The radial velocity for all observable lines is pretty

low within the limited sensitivity of the adopted spectral dispersion.

Overall, the photometric and spectral appearances are compatible with a

CV eruption.  Worth noticing are the slow rising time (commented upon also

in Atel #11867), the unusual strength of HeII emission and the possibly
bluer colors 
compared to quiescence.

The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory made an XRT photon counting mode exposure
of the candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018dyb (Pan et al. 2018,
ATEL #11865) starting on 2018 July 18 at 14:04:51 UT, for a net exposure
of 2.98 ks. 

No source is detected at the location of AT2018dyb.  A standard extraction
circle with a radius of 20 pixels finds 10 events; background regions of
equivalent size find a similar number of events. 

Assuming a kT = 0.2 keV blackbody spectrum as typical of TDEs, Galactic
absorption of 2.0 E+21 cm^-2, 10 total photons in 2.98 ks equates to a
flux of F < 7 E-14 erg/cm^2/s in the 0.3-10 keV band.  This might be regarded
as a conservative upper limit.  The corresponding luminosity limit for
a redshift of z = 0.018 is L < 5 E+40 erg/s.

Notes: 
When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from the
SN spectrum.  Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy.

(1) Young SN Ia with complex absorption feature near 6100 A.  The feature
has two shoulders on either side of the primary absorption.  We interpret
the strongest absorption as photospheric Si II 6355 with a velocity of
-12,200 km/s, the bluer shoulder as high-velocity Si II 6355 with a velocity
of -17,600 km/s, and C II 6580 with a velocity of -17,300 km/s. 
(2) Young SN Ia similar to SN 1991T.  The continuum is red, consistent
with a young SN Ia with E(B-V) ~ 0.5 mag of host-galaxy reddening.  We
measure a host-galaxy Na D EW of 1.2 A, indicating a host-galaxy extinction
of Av >~ 1 mag (e.g., Phillips et al., 2013, ApJ, 779, 38).

ATEL #11869,X-ray,"
GRS 1739-278 is a black hole candidate that was first detected in outburst
in 1996 (Paul et al., 1996). This outburst lasted ~11 months. In 2014 March
it experienced a new outburst (Krimm et al., 2014). The main 2014 outburst
of GRS 1739-278 lasted for ~1.2 years and was subsequently followed (see
Yan & Yu, 2017a) by several rebrightenings (which are episodes of increase
in the flux after the end of the main outburst although they never reach
a maximum flux similar to that during the peak of the main outburst). 

After the final Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory/X-ray Telescope (Swift/XRT)
observation reported by Yan & Yu (2017a), Swift continued to monitor the
source, albeit less frequently than before. In February 2017 the source
was still detected although at a low level (Yan & Yu, 2017b; ATel #10137).
We requested observations using the Swift/XRT to establish the source activity
level ~1.25 years after the end of the last reported observation by Yan
& Yu (2017b; ATel #10137). Our observation of 2018 May indicated that the
source was still active at a low level having a (0.5-10 keV) count rate
of ~0.6 c/s. We requested more XRT observations to confirm and follow the
current activity status of the source. Our first follow-up observation
was performed on 2018 July 18 and the source was detected at a very similar
count rate level as during the 2018 May observation.  

We analysed the source spectra extracted from our two currently available
XRT observations by fitting an absorbed power-law model. We fixed the equivalent
hydrogen column density to Nh = 2.5E22 cm<sup>-2</sup> (Yan & Yu, 2017a).
The fits indicated a photon index &Gamma; = 1.6 +/- 0.3 which suggests
that the source is in the so-called black hole hard state. The unabsorbed
flux is ~5E-11 erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (0.5-10 keV) which corresponds to an
unabsorbed luminosity of ~4E35 erg/s (0.5-10 keV, assuming a distance of
7.5 kpc; Yan & Yu, 2017a). This is similar to the flux level of the 2017
February observation reported in ATel #10137. We found that the source
was in the field-of-view of several XRT pointings between February 2017
and our newly requested observations and the source was consistently detected
at very similar fluxes. Therefore, it appears that the source has been
in a quasi-steady state for about ~1.5 years now. 

The current quasi-steady state is not representative of the quiescent level
of the source since a pre-outburst XRT observation, observed on 2012 May
13, did not detect the source. The (0.5-10 keV) count rate upper limit
derived from this observation is <4E-2 c/s (using the 90% prescription
by Gehrels, 1986), which is a factor of >15 lower than the count rate we
detected in our recent XRT observations. Such a quasi-steady low level
state is unusual for black-hole X-ray transients. Multi-wavelength observations
are necessary in order to get more insight into the physical process(es)
at work during this state. We will continue to monitor the source using
the XRT once every month until it is Sun constrained in 2018 November.

We thank the Swift team for scheduling our observations.

In 2018 July 17.772 UT, we registered the onset of a strong outburst which
reached maximum brightness of 11.7 mag in the Rc band. It was brighter
then the outburst on 2014 July 26 that was recorded as the most brightest
in our search (ATel #6347, #6355, #6364, #6385).The observations were performed
with the 25-cm telescope and electronic tube equipped by a microchannel
plate. The outburst continued more than 6 hours. The last estimate Rc =
12.6 was made on 18.022 UT, the star was far from a quiescent state. Like
the previous registered giant outburst, the new one happened in an eclipse,
the orbital phases were between 0.95 and 0.97. The precession period phase
was 0.17 relative to T3 moment of maximum divergence of relativistic emission
components. We have obtained the spectrum with the SAO 1-m telescope and
UAGS spectrograph on July 17.83 UT with the signal accumulation of 4800
s, just in the maximum light. Spectral range was 3900 - 7850 &Aring;, resolution
was 6 &Aring;. The H&alpha; line has FWHM = 18 &Aring;, what is typical
for the quiescent state, FWZI = 93 &Aring;, and EW = 300 &Aring;. The He
I emission lines are also typical for quiescence. However, the He II 4686
&Aring; emission line is very bright and wide, so it forms common band
with the Bowen blend and the He I 4713 &Aring; line having FWHM = 78 &Aring;
and EW = 160 &Aring;. We identified short-wavelength relativistic components
of H and He I. Such a spectral behavior differs from  the outburst of 2014
July 26 when the H&alpha; line profile had a wide pedestal. 

SS 433 was observed  with the RATAN-600 radio telescope at 2-30 GHz on
2018 July 17.86 UT in the frame of the long-term monitoring of the microquasars

by  two-three times during a day reaching  1.1 Jy at 4.7 GHz. Spectral
index was -0.47, what is the usual value in the outbursts. The radio light
curves of SS 433 are given below. They will be updated daily.

ATEL #11871,X-ray,"
Fermi GBM triggered on 2 bright SGR-like bursts on 2018 July 5th (GCN #22905).
The two bursts were separated by 19 minutes, and locate to the same area
in the sky, indicating a common origin. The 3 sigma contour of the first
and brightest burst location encompass 2 known magnetars, CXOU J171405.7-381031
(Takuro et al. 2010) and 1RXS J170849.0-400910 (Israel et al. 1999). The
latter is monitored by XRT with 1 observation every 20 days on average.
We analyzed the first (and currently only) XRT observation of 1RXS J170849.0-400910
that is taken after the GBM triggers (obsID 00035318161, observation date
2018 July 17). We find an absorption corrected 0.5-10 keV flux of about
(3.6\pm0.4)e-10 erg/s/cm2. This flux level is a factor 2 to 3 brighter
than its historic flux (Campana et al. 2007, Scholz et al. 2014). We also
analyzed three Swift XRT observations from the source taken prior to the
2 GBM bursts (obs IDs 00035318157, 00035318159, 00035318160), the last
of which was taken on 2018 June 27. We fit all spectra simultaneously and
find that the 3 observations prior to the GBM triggers are consistent with
the same flux level of about (2.0\pm0.2)e-10 erg/s/cm2, 80% dimmer than
the current value from the source. We conclude that the brightening in
the magnetar 1RXS J170849.0-400910 is likely real and took place subsequent
to June 27. Further, the brightening is accompanied by a marginal hardening
of the spectrum. 

Given the location of the 2 bursts in the sky and the contemporaneous detection
of X-ray brightening from 1RXS J170849.0-400910, we conclude that these
2 events are likely associated. We note that such bright bursts, if indeed
related to 1RXS J170849.0-400910, are detected from this magnetar for the
first time (see also ATEL#10107). 

We strongly encourage X-ray and multi-wavelength follow-up observations
of the source to cover its first reported outburst.

Here we report that the 2018 classical nova eruption from the known dwarf
nova V392 Per has apparently entered the post-nova eruption nebular phase
(see, ATel #11588, #11590, #11594, #11601, #11605, #11617, #11647, #11846

and <a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/aac26c/meta"">Darnley
& Starrfield 2018</a>). 

Unlike the our previous LT spectra (ATel #11601 and #11846), this spectrum
was taken with the SPRAT instrument on the LT (R~350). 

This new spectrum, as with the previous, show Balmer emission from H&alpha;
- H&delta; and an array of He I lines. However, these lines have now been
joined by extremely strong [O III] lines at 4363, 4959 and 5007 &#8491;,
and He II (4686 &#8491;). The [O III] (5007) line rivals H&alpha; in brightness;
[O III] (4363) and He II (4686) are stronger than H&beta;. The [O III]
lines are double-peaked, whereas the H I, He I, and He II lines retain
the triple peaked structure reported in ATel #11846, the width of the [O
III] lines are consistent with those of H I. 

The first Swift observations of this system are imminent, we strongly encourage
follow-up observations, particularly high-resolution optical spectroscopy.

We report that our recent announcement of the flux brightening from the
magnetar 1RXS J170849.0-400910 based on Swift XRT analysis of obs. ID 00035318161

issue yet, the flux of only the latest XRT observation differs by a factor
2 from fluxes that have been derived by multiple colleagues.

(ATel #11856) was taken on 2018 July 16.17 UT. 

Both spectra show strong Balmer emission lines (H&alpha; to H&delta;).
The FWHM of the H&alpha; emission line is ~2700 km/s for PNV J00420765+4119438
and ~850 km/s for PNV J00425261+4118409. 

The spectrum of PNV J00420765+4119438 also shows Fe II emission lines (multiple
42), along with possibly O I (7773 &#8491;). The continuum of PNV J00420765+4119438
is relatively flat. 

Other than Balmer emission, PNV J00425261+4118409 exhibits a featureless
but blue continuum. 

We conclude that both PNV J00420765+4119438 and PNV J00425261+4118409 are
classical nova eruptions in M31. PNV J00420765+4119438 likely belongs to
the Fe II taxonomic class, whereas PNV J00425261+4118409 was probably caught
during the final rise or around peak luminosity. Follow-up observations
are, as always, encouraged.

or transient source at this location. The PS1 photometry for the source
(Chambers et al 2016, arXiv:1612.05560) implies a mean quiescent mag of
V~18.2, so a rise of at least 3.9 mag from quiescence so far and a total
rise time of > 1 week. A link to the current ASAS-SN Sky Patrol light curve
can be found below. 

We obtained a 300 s optical spectrum with SPRAT on the Liverpool Telescope
on 2018 July 17.9. While of modest signal-to-noise in the lines, the R~350
spectrum shows a blue continuum, with Hbeta, Hgamma, and perhaps Hdelta
in absorption at z~0. No Halpha absorption is seen, perhaps because it
is filled in by emission. There may be HeII 4686 in broad (possibly double-peaked)
emission, but it is only weakly detected.  

We also observed the source with Swift/XRT for 1 ksec on 2018 July 17.7.
ASASSN-18pe was clearly detected but faint, with 13 events. A basic spectral
analysis gives an X-ray flux of 5(-3/+7)e-13 erg/s/cm^2 (0.5-10 keV) for
a power-law fit with a photon index of 2.5(1.0) and N_H = 5.8e20 cm^-2.
This flux gives an X-ray luminosity of 6e31(d/kpc)^2 erg/s. A second Swift
observation is planned for July 22. 

The optical spectrum and probable low X-ray luminosity would normally suggest
that the most likely explanation for ASASSN-18pe is a dwarf nova rising
to outburst. However, the slow rise is unusual for a dwarf nova (e.g.,
Szkody & Mattei 1984, PASP, 96, 988). The rare systems with slow rises,
such as GK Per, are generally interpreted to have long orbital periods
and evolved secondaries (e.g., Crampton et al. 1986, ApJ, 300, 788). The
modest foreground extinction (likely no more than A_V ~ 0.5) and faint
quiescent magnitude would imply a distance of at least a few kpc if the
secondary is evolved, in turn implying an X-ray luminosity of ~> 5e32 erg/s.

We emphasize that, while several aspects of the transient resemble a dwarf
nova, the slow rise time and possible high luminosity suggest that other,
more exotic possibilities, such as an unusual X-ray binary outburst, should
be considered. Additional observations, including higher-resolution optical
spectroscopy, are encouraged.

ATEL #11868,Infra-Red,"
We have performed the optical and near-infrared photometric observations
of 
AT 2018cow (ATEL #11727) using the Hiroshima One-shot Wide-field Polarimeter

(HOWPol; Kawabata et al. 2010), and the Hiroshima Optical and Near-InfraRed

camera (HONIR; Akitaya et al. 2014) attached to the 1.5-m Kanata 
telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory since Jun 21. 

The point-spread function (PSF) photometry were carried out using IRAF/DAOPHOT.

We measured the optical magnitudes as B=15.1, V=14.9, R=14.9, and I=15.0
mag 
on Jul 21.7. We also measured the near-infrared magnitudes as J=15.6, 
H=15.4, and Ks=14.9 on Jul 24.5. 

The optical light curves show almost linearly decline until 
Jul 1, and the short plateau stage between Jul 1 and 10. After that, the
optical 
luminosity rapidly fades, again. We measured the ~17.2, ~17.2, and 
~16.8 magnitudes 
in V, R, and I bands on Jul 10.5, respectively. The large decline rates
of the 
light curves are quite large comparing to the broad-lined Type Ic (Ic-BL)
and 
Type Ib/c supernovae.

We have observed the position of AT2018cow (ATel #11727) with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) on 2018-07-03 between 09:00-13:45 UT at
central frequencies of 5.5 GHz and 9 GHz with a bandwidth of 2 GHz in each
band. We report preliminary flux densities of ~0.4 mJy at 5.5 GHz and ~1.0
mJy at 9 GHz. 

We have also observed AT2018cow on 2018-07-05 from 13:30-15:30 UT at a
central frequency of 34 GHz with a bandwidth of 4 GHz. We report a preliminary
flux density of ~10 mJy. 

Analysis is ongoing and subsequent epochs are planned.

ATEL #11863,Optical,"
I report constraints on the possible progenitor of the LMC Nova ASASSN-18pf,
based on Magellanic Cloud Photometric Survey (MCPS; Zaritsky et al. 1997)
archival data. There is a counterpart source located at coordinates: 

R.A.=85.44513 deg. and Dec.=-71.80994 deg.  

or 2.5 arc seconds away from the reported ASAS-SN position: 

R.A.=05:41:46.461; Dec.=-71:48:37.59. 

Taking into account the pixel scale of the ASAS-SN cameras (8""/pixel),
both sources are identical within the positional uncertainty. The source
has the following magnitudes: 

B=21.537+/-0.119; 
V=21.105+/-0.096; 
I=20.806+/-0.216. 

The extinction in the direction of the transient was estimated utilizing
the LMC Extinction Retrieval Service at the MCPS data products section
website (http://djuma.as.arizona.edu/~dennis/lmcext.html). Using all the
stars within 10 arc minutes search radius (1689 objects) Av=0.6+/-0.45
was estimated.  

Hence, taking into account the distance modulus to the LMC (m-M)0=18.515+/-0.085
mag (Clementini et al. 2003) the following extinction corrected colors
are obtained: 

(B-V)0=0.25+/-0.21;  
(V-I)0=-0.011+/-0.554, 

along with absolute magnitude of the object: 

V0=2.0+/-0.5.  

According to Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018 (Gaia Data Release 2; see their
Figure 1) the object should be present in both Gaia data releases, but
probably it is not reliably detected due to crowding. The calculated extinction
corrected colors and absolute V band magnitude of the archival object are
consistent with a FOIII - F5III star at the distance of the LMC. This object
probably is the donor star of the binary system. Taking into account the
MCPS data, the amplitude of the outburst is ~8.3+/-0.1 magnitudes in V
band at the moment of the approximate maximum.

We obtained optical low-resolution spectra (range 3600-9300 Angstroms,
FWHM res. ~ 8 Angstroms) of 12 supernovae candidates discovered mainly
by ASAS-SN (Shappee et al. 2014, ApJ, 788, 48; ATel #11713, #11730, #11832,

Notes: 
When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from the
SN spectrum.  Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy.

(1) We measure a Si II 6355 velocity of -9,800 km/s 
(2) Blue and relatively featureless continuum.  We identify a weak spectral
feature that is consistent with H alpha at a velocity of -17,400. 
(3) Blue continuum with several spectral features.  We identify some features
as likely being He II 4686, H beta, He I 5876, and H alpha in emission.
All lines have FWHM of ~12,000 km/s.  Using a distance modulus of 34.4
mag to the host galaxy and correcting for MW extinction, the discovery
magnitude corresponds to M = -18.5 mag, similar to other TDEs, but more
luminous than most SNe II.  From the confirmation image, the transient
appears coincident with the nucleus of its host galaxy.  Further follow-up
observations are encouraged.

These PD are consistent with those presented

Follow-up observations, especially spectroscopy, are strongly encouraged.

Also, due to its location in the LMC, there might be images of this position

taken during the gap in ASAS-SN coverage, which could help to establish

the evolution of this bright transient.

ATEL #11859,Nova,"
We report further spectroscopic observations of the classical nova Nova
Sct 2018 = TCP J18292290-1430460 between 2018 Jun 30.8 UT and Jul 14.8
UT.  Dispersions range from 600 (Alpy600 and low resolution instruments)
to 12000 (eShel and LHIRES) between 3700 and 7900A.  Signal to noise values
range from ~20 to >80.  The low resolution spectra displayed little overall
change in the spectrum since the observations reported in (ATel #11802).
The Balmer lines remain the dominant emission with absorption troughs
(and red wings) extending  to about -2300 km/s (minimum around -2000 km/s)
and narrow absorption at around -900 km/s, the emission profiles were slightly
stronger on the blue side.  The Halpha to Hbeta emission ratio was about
5 on Jul  14.8.  Echelle observations show that the Na I D broad emission
appeared between Jul 6.8 and Jul. 7.8 (ATel #11826) and was still present
on the Jul 14.8 echelle spectrum, the detached absorption  broad absorption
features, discernible even at low resolution, are now at -1800 km/s and
-1000 km/s but have weakened relative to Jul 7.   He I 5876, 6678 show
persistent detached absorption at -1800 km/s and no emission.  Fe II 4923,
5018 (partly blended in absorption with He I), 5169 all show the same broad
absorption components but these appear to be slightly shifted (-1700 km/s,-900
to -1000 km/s) and possibly fragmenting relative to the earlier report.
The Fe II emission profiles are show increasingly strong double peaked
structure (-460,+670 km/s) with red wings as extended as those of the Balmer
and Na I D emission lines.  The Si II 6347,6371 lines are now undetectable.
No [O I] or forbidden Fe-peak lines have appeared, additional neutral
C and O lines are detectable throughout this period (e.g. O I 7773) and
the nova remains in the optically thick stage of the expansion, and with
the exception of the rapid onset and persistence of the sodium emission,
the nova closely resembles the early stages of the Fe-curtain.  The details
of the individual observations and the reduced spectra are publicly available
at http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras_DataBase/Novae/2018_NovaSct2018.htm

The transient <a href=http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/unconf/followups/J18010186-2951258.html>TCP
J18010186-2951258</a> was first discovered by T. Kojima on UT  2018 07
13.494. The <a href=https://asas-sn-s.asc.ohio-state.edu/light_curves/40857b7e-c8ad-4144-91a9-1ad5f12d66ee>ASAS-SN
Sky Patrol light curve </a> (Shappee et al. 2014; Kochanek et al. 2017)
suggested this to be a probable microlensing event. We take i-band follow-up
images with 40cm robotic telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory, and
the refined coordinates based on the follow-up observations are: (RA =
18:01:01.84 Dec=-29:51:23.8). 

ASAS-SN has been regularly observing the field containing TCP J18010186-2951258
since 2016-03-10. The latest ASAS-SN photometry on UT 2018-07-14.1132905
shows that the source is at V = 10.73, and this is brighter than all previous
ASAS-SN measurements. The light curve is consistent with single-lens microlensing
models. Since we only have the rising part of the light curve, and due
to the degeneracy of blending, there are a number of single-lens microlensing
models compatible with data. One possible (though not unique) class of
microlensing models expect the event reaching high peak magnification on
around UT 2018 07 15 (<a href=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~assassin/followup/TCPJ18010186-2951258.pdf>see
an example model here</a>). A high-magnification microlensing event is
sensitive to planets orbiting the lens star, and high-cadence photometric
follow ups are encouraged in the near future.  

We thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their continued support
of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
through grant GBMF5490 to the Ohio State University, NSF grant AST-1515927,

"
ATEL #11854,Gamma Ray,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of the two instruments on the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed renewed gamma-ray flaring activity
from a source positionally consistent with the flat-spectrum radio quasar
PKS 0035-282, also known as 3FGL J0038.0-2501 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS,
218, 23), with coordinates R.A. = 9.5613975 deg, Decl. = -24.9839542 deg
(J2000; Beasley et al. 2002 ApJS, 141, 13), and redshift z=0.49806 (Jones
et al. 2009, MNRAS, 399, 683).   

Preliminary analysis indicates that this source went into a high-flux state
starting on 30 June 2018, and brightened over the following weeks, reaching
a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (1.6+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons
cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only) on 13 July 2018. The latter corresponds
to a flux increase of a factor of more than 120 relative to the average
flux reported in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL). This is the highest
LAT daily flux ever observed for this source, exceeding that observed during
a previous flaring episode in November 2017, reported in ATel #10951. The
corresponding photon index is 2.2+/-0.1, and is consistent with the 3FGL
value of 2.4+/-0.1 within the uncertainties. 

Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray
monitoring of this source will continue. This source is being added to
the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently, a preliminary estimation
of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi-LAT will be publicly available
(http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/). We encourage
further multifrequency observations of this source. For this source, the
Fermi-LAT contact person is Janeth Valverde (valverde@llr.in2p3.fr).  

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

ATEL #11851,Radio,"
The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (<a href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2013PASA...30...17M"">Manchester
et al. 2013</a>) project monitors pulse times of arrival for 24 millisecond
pulsars in the Galaxy on a fortnightly cadence. Since 2017 June, we have
been commensally searching for fast radio bursts (FRBs) when timing pulsars
with the 13-beam 20-cm multibeam receiver. These data are recorded with
standard instrumentation (<a href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2010MNRAS.409..619K/"">Keith
et al., MNRAS, 2010</a>) and searched in real time for FRBs using the Heimdall
software (<a href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2012ASPC..461...37B/"">Barsdell
et al.  2011</a>).  

On 2018-08-07 at 10:08:42.7 UTC (2018-07-10.4227164352), we detected a
burst with a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 22, at the dispersion measure
(DM) of 1469.873 pc cm<sup>-3</sup>, in the field of the millisecond pulsar
PSR J1744-1134 (DM = 3.14 pc cm<sup>-3</sup>). The burst was detected in
beam 7 of the receiver, which at the time was pointed at a position of
(RA, DEC = 17:46:12, -11:45:47; J2000). The burst width (full width at
half maximum) was 1 ms and its inferred fluence was 5 Jy ms if at the centre
of beam 7. We note that the location of the burst within the telescope
beam is highly uncertain (> 0.25 deg); consequently, the fluence measurement
is biased low (<a href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017arXiv171011493M/"">Macquart
& Ekers 2017</a>). 

This position is approximately 8.7 degrees off of the galactic plane. The
galactic contribution is estimated to be 257 pc cm<sup>-3</sup> from the
NE2001 model (<a href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2002astro.ph..7156C/"">Cordes
& Lazio, 2001</a>) and 223 pc cm<sup>-3</sup> from the YMW16 model (<a
href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017ApJ...835...29Y/"">Yao et al.
2017</a>). Assuming host contribution to the DM of 100 pc cm<sup>-3</sup>,
we estimate the redshift to be 1.6. 

We encourage prompt follow-up with available facilities. 

Two plots of the burst can be found here: 

<a href=""http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~soslowski/FRB180714/"">http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~soslowski/FRB180714/</a>

(see <a href=""http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/unconf/followups/J00414889+4109148.html"">CBAT
TOCP</a> and ATel #11807) was taken on 2018 July 07.18 UT.  

Both spectra show strong Balmer emission lines (H&alpha; to H&delta;) and
both also show the three emission lines from multiplet 42 of Fe II. The
FWHM of the H&alpha; emission line is ~1200 km/s for PNV J00424144+4117377
and ~1500 km/s for PNV J00414889+4109148.  

PNV J00414889+4109148 also shows tentative evidence for the presence of
Fe II (multiple 48, 49, and 74) emission lines, along with possibly O I
(7773 &#8491;). 

We conclude that both PNV J00424144+4117377 and PNV J00414889+4109148 are
classical nova eruptions in M31 and that they likely belong to the Fe II
taxonomic class.  Follow-up observations are, as always, encouraged.

arm 5800-9400&#8491;) of FRODOSpec, with an integration time of 3&times;180s
for both arms.  

The spectrum was collected at a high airmass (>2), may have suffered from
acquisition issues, and there was some thin cirrus around. As such, the
throughput in the blue arm of the spectrum was very poor, therefore we
only report on the red arm (in which the S/N was also low). 

Only three emission lines are visible in the red arm, H&alpha;, and He
I (6678 and 7065&#8491;). The profile of all three lines are similar, but
they are all remarkably different from those reported in ATel #11601. 

The line profiles show a narrow (~50 km/s) and bright emission spike at
approximately the rest wavelength of each line, bracketed on either side
by fainter but broad emission bumps. For H&alpha;, the blueward and redward
bumps are shifted by ~&plusmn;1750 km/s and have a FWHM of ~1600 km/s.
The blueward bump is ~2/3 the height of the redward bump (which is ~half
the height of the central narrow peak). 

As V392 Per exits the Sun, follow-up observations, particularly spectroscopy,
are strongly encouraged. The first of a series of Swift observations are
planned to begin on 2018 July 20.

"
ATEL #11847,Gamma Ray,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of the two instruments on the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed increasing gamma-ray activity from
a source positionally consistent with the flat-spectrum radio quasar NVSS
J163547+362930 with coordinates R.A. = 248.94682 deg, Decl. = +36.49166
deg (J2000; Petrov & Taylor 2011, AJ, 142, 89), and redshift z=3.6 (Paris
et al., 2014, A&A, 563, A54).   

Preliminary analysis indicates that this source went into a high-flux state
starting on 2018 July 7, reaching a peak daily averaged gamma-ray flux
(E>100MeV) of (6.4+/-1.5) X 10^-7 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty
only) on July 8. This is the highest LAT daily flux ever observed for this
source. This quasar was recently reported as a new gamma-ray emitter by
Ackermann et al. (2017, ApJL, 837, 5). The corresponding photon index is
2.6+/-0.2, indicating a harder spectrum than that reported in Ackermann
et al. (photon index = 3.2+/-0.1). 

Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray
monitoring of this source will continue.  We encourage further multifrequency
observations of this source. For this source the Fermi-LAT contact persons
are Vaidehi S. Paliya (vpaliya@g.clemson.edu) and C. C. Teddy Cheung (teddy.cheung@nrl.navy.mil).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

ATEL #11848,Optical,"
During the ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, <a
href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/%61bs/2013arXiv1310.2241S"">Shappee et al.
2014</a>), using data from the quadruple 14-cm ""Brutus"" telescope in Haleakala,
Hawaii, the quadruple 14-cm ""Payne-Gaposchkin"" telescope in Sutherland,
South Africa, and the quadruple 14-cm ""Cassius"" and ""Paczynski"" telescopes
in Cerro Tololo, Chile, we discovered a new transient source, most likely
a supernova, in the galaxy Mrk 590 (NGC 0863), a well-known Seyfert 1 AGN.

ASASSN-18pb (AT 2018djd)  was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-07-12.36
at V~16.2 mag. We also detect the object in images obtained on UT 2018-07-11.36
(g~16.8) and UT 2018-07-10.61 (V~16.5). We do not detect (g>17.7) the object
in images taken on UT 2018-07-05.11 and before. An image obtained on 2018-07-12
by J. Brimacombe confirms the discovery of the transient. This <a href=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/assassin/followup/asassn-18pb.png>figure</a>
shows the archival SDSS g-band image of the host (left) and the confirmation
image (right). The red circle has a radius of 5"" and is centered on the
position of the transient in the confirmation image. 

The position of ASASSN-18pb is approximately 4.5"" North and 6.4"" East from
the center of the galaxy NGC 0863 (z=0.026385, d=107 Mpc, via NED), giving
an absolute V-band magnitude of approximately -19.1 (m-M=35.15, A_V=0.101).

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient.

ATEL #11844,Optical,"
Photometry obtained by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN;
Shappee et al. 2014, ApJ, 788, 48; Kochanek et al. 2017, PASP, 129, 104502)
reveals that in mid-May, the intermediate polar FO Aquarii (FO Aqr) faded
by 0.4 mag in the g band, consistent with a decrease in the binary's mass-transfer
rate. In the linked figure, we plot the 124 g-band observations obtained
by ASAS-SN between 2018 April 17-June 29, along with the best-fit sigmoid
step-function model. Because FO Aqr has several large-amplitude, short-period
variations in its light curve, the ASAS-SN points show considerable scatter
with respect to the model; still, the fading behavior is readily apparent.

Although FO Aqr remained mired in its 2017 low state as it approached solar
conjunction in 2018 January, the presence of a bright state during April
and early May establishes that the 2018 faint state is not a continuation
of the 2017 event.

FO Aqr has now experienced separate low states in 2016, 2017, and 2018.
Prior to 2016, it had never been observed in one, despite a nearly century-long
observational record (e.g., Garnavich & Szkody 1988, PASP, 100, 1522).
The 0.4-mag depth of the 2018 low state is considerably less than its counterparts
in 2016 (~2 mag; Littlefield et al. 2016, ApJ, 833, 93) and 2017 (~1 mag;
Littlefield et al., in prep.). Nevertheless, Lomb-Scargle periodograms
of our time-series photometry of the 2018 low state --- obtained with the
University of Notre Dame's 80-cm Sarah L. Krizmanich Telescope and co-author
Hambsch's 40-cm optimized Dall-Kirkham telescope --- show greatly elevated
power at the spin-orbit beat frequency when compared with the system's
high-state power spectrum (Kennedy et al. 2016, MNRAS, 459, 3622), a change
that was also present throughout both the 2016 and 2017 low states (Littlefield
et al., in prep.). The observed power spectrum implies a direct interaction
between the white dwarf's magnetosphere and the accretion flow (Ferrario
& Wickramasinghe 1999, MNRAS, 309, 517).

The high state in early 2018 was unusually faint by FO Aqr's historical
standards. In ASAS-SN V-band photometry from 2013, 2014, and 2015, the
system's average magnitude was stable at V = 13.57 +/- 0.01. By contrast,
in a high state sandwiched between the 2016 and 2017 fading episodes, the
average magnitude was V = 13.74 +/- 0.02, and during the bright interlude
in early 2018, it was just V = 13.92 +/- 0.04. Thus, FO Aqr's high states
are becoming progressively fainter, suggesting that even after a fading
event has concluded, the system's mass-transfer rate does not return to
its original level.

The AZTEC (Arizona Transient Exploration and Characterization) collaboration
reports an optical spectrum of AT2018dfg obtained on UT 2018 Jul 11.12
(JD 2458310.61) with the Magellan Clay telescope (+ LDSS3 spectrograph,
VPH-all grism).  The spectrum reveals an unresolved narrow H-alpha emission
line with a velocity of 475 km/s, and an intermediate H-alpha emission
line with a velocity of ~2000 km/s.  A similar profile is seen in H-beta.
There are also strong Na ID absorption lines associated with the host galaxy,
suggesting high local extinction. The narrow and intermediate emission
lines, considerable extinction, and redshift of NGC 5468 (0.00948 from
NED) indicates that AT2018dfg is likely a IIn SNe, although other types
of CSM interacting SNe cannot be ruled out. Cross-correlation using GELATO
(Harutyunyan et al., 2008, A&A, 488, 383) finds a good match with the IIn
SN 1998S 3.5 days post explosion.

ATEL #11842,Optical,"
We report the classification of kait-18ad (= AT2018dfy) from a spectroscopic
observation made on 2017 July 11 UT with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer
(LRIS) on the Keck I telescope. The target was supplied by the Lick Observatory
Supernova Search. 

Name      | IAU Name  | RA (J2000)  | Dec (J2000)  | z     | Type |  Notes

kait-18ad | AT2018dfy | 21:43:32.91 | +43:32:58.20 | 0.014 | IIn  | (1)

Notes: When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from
the SN spectrum. Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy.

(1) The continuum is blue with intermediate-width H alpha, H beta, and
He II 4686 emission lines.  H beta has a FWHM of 1000 km/s.  While it is
possible that this object will evolve into a different SN type, the current
spectrum is consistent with a Type IIn supernova.

"
ATEL #11843,X-ray,"
Following the detection of hard X-ray emission from AT2018cow by 
NuSTAR and INTEGRAL (ATels #11775, #11788), INTEGRAL continued 
observations of the source, accumulating in total 
902&nbsp;ks between 2018-06-22 14:54:18 
and 2018-07-08 06:42:28 (satellite orbits 1968 to 
1973). 

In the second part of the observation, from 2018-06-30 14:30:56 to 
2018-07-08 06:42:28 (satellite orbits from 1971 to 1973), with a total

on-source time of 390&nbsp;ks we do not detect the source, putting an upper

limit of 1.5&times;10<sup>-11</sup>&nbsp;erg&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>
in 
20-40 keV and 2.5&times;10<sup>-11</sup>&nbsp;erg&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>
in 
40-80 keV energy range (5 sigma confidence). This non-detection is 
consistent with the evolution following t<sup>-1</sup> starting from 
2018-06-16 10:35:02 (ATel #11727), similar to that observed by NuSTAR 
(ATel #11775) at lower energy 
(see <a href=""https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1310126"">Figure</a>). We 
note marginal evidence deviations from the t<sup>-1</sup> decay, close

in time to the flux increase found in Swift/XRT (ATel #11801). 

The upper limit in this epoch is also consistent with the spectrum 
measured by NuSTAR at 2018-07-02 14:01:09 (ATel #11813).  The combined

spectrum extracted from the NuSTAR observation and an integrated 
IBIS/ISGRI spectrum (giving upper limits) can be fitted by a single 
powerlaw with a slope of 1.4+/-0.02 (1 sigma error), with reduced 
Chi<sup>2</sup> of 1.4 for 105 d.o.f 
(see <a href=""https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1310123"">Figure</a>). 

Between 2018-06-22 18:26:58 and 2018-07-08 05:58:39 
INTEGRAL/IBIS/ISGRI has observed AT2018cow for 68% of the time, 
providing an opportunity for an exhaustive search for any short bursts

associated with the source. We do not detect any such events on time 
scales of 1 s and 10 s. We put an upper limit (3 sigma) on the fluence
of 
1.3&times;10<sup>-8</sup> &nbsp;erg&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup> and 3.6&times;10<sup>-8</sup>&nbsp;erg&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>
in 
the 20-80 keV energy range (assuming a powerlaw with a slope of -2). 

Finally, we have searched for any impulsive GRB-like events in the 
observations of INTEGRAL's all-sky monitors (SPI-ACS and IBIS/Veto, 
IBIS/ISGRI & IBIS/PICsIT). For this analysis, we have chosen the time 
interval from 2018-06-12 
02:27:53 UTC to 2018-06-17 01:02:50 (INTEGRAL orbits 1964 and 1965). This
interval includes the last non-detection of the AT2018cow on 2018-06-13
(ATeL 
#11738). During this time interval the source position was observable 
for 88% of time, but the sensitivity of the INTEGRAL all-sky monitors 
to any impulsive events from the position of AT2018cow was changing, 
within one of the two positions. In the first case (58% of time), the 
orientation was close to optimal for the SPI-ACS, reasonably suitable 
for IBIS/ISGRI and IBIS/PICsIT, but not suitable for IBIS/Veto. The 
rest of the time, the INTEGRAL pointing direction implied suppressed 
response of all instruments except for IBIS/Veto. 

We identify two events which we classify as likely GRBs, at UTC 2018-06-12
18:50:09 and 2018-06-15 
11:05:57. Both events are detected in SPI-ACS and IBIS/Veto, when 
INTEGRAL orientation had an implied suppressed response of IBIS/Veto 
to any GRBs from the direction of AT2018cow, allowing us to disfavors 
association of these events with AT2018cow.  We, therefore, estimate a

typical 3-sigma fluence upper limit in the whole time interval of 5&times;10<sup>-7</sup>&nbsp;erg&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>
at a time scale of 1 sec and 12&times;10<sup>-7</sup>&nbsp;erg&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup>
at the 8-sec 
time scale.

ATEL #11836,Optical,"
The Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) Unbiased Transient Survey (NUTS; 
ATel #8992) reports an update on the spectroscopic follow-up of SN 2018cow
(ATel #11727). 

The latest observation with the 2.56 m Nordic Optical Telescope 
equipped with ALFOSC (range 350-950 nm; resolution 1.4 nm FWHM) was performed
on UT July 08.03. 

The transient spectrum is still dominated by a blue continuum (T_BB~13000
K). A number of broad shallow emission lines are now emerging. After removal
of the blue continuum, we tentatively attribute all these emissions to
He, namely HeI  (447.1, 492.2, 501.5, 587.6, 667.8 and 706.5 nm) and He
II (468.6 nm) transitions. The FWHM of the emission identified as He I
5876A is about 7000 km/s. 
From a narrow, unresolved H-alpha line visible in the spectrum, we estimate
a redshift of z = 0.0136 (this value is very close to SDSS redshift, 0.01406,
for the parent galaxy).  
Given this redshift, the peaks of the broad emissions, if correctly identified
as He lines, appear significantly redshifted (up to ~70A) with respect
to the rest frame position. 

Formally, we should define SN 2008cow as a Type Ib supernova, although
this event shows an unprecedented spectrum for a supernova of this class.

"
ATEL #11837,Optical,"
We report optical spectroscopic observation of supernova candidates ASASSN-18ll/2018cdh
(ATel #11686) and ASASSN-18od/2018dda (ATel #11832) using OSMOS (range
398-686 nm) mounted on the MDM 2.4m telescope at KPNO. Both targets were
discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee
et al. 2014). 

ASASSN-18ll was observed on 2018-06-17.28 and 2018-07-06.23 with MDM/OSMOS.
The spectrum on 2018-06-17.28 shows narrow P-Cygni profiles of HeI (velocity
~1100 km/s) without any presence of broad emission features. This is consistent
with several SNe Ibn (e.g. SN 2010al and PTF12ldy) near maximum. The later
spectrum obtained on 2018-07-06.23 does not show any prominent P-Cygni
profiles, but only weak emission line of HeI, which is also consistent
with Type Ibn SN PTF12ldy (Hosseinzadeh et al. 2016), around a month after
the maximum light. 

ASASSN-18od, observed on 2018-07-06.42, is a type Ia SN a week before the
maximum. The age has been estimated using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007,
ApJ, 666, 1024) and the redshift is consistent with that of the host galaxy
(z=0.018229).

(BTS; ATel #11688) reports classifications of the following targets. Spectra
have been obtained with the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM)
(range 350-950nm, spectral resolution R~100) mounted on the Palomar 60-inch
(P60) telescope (Blagorodnova et. al. 2018, PASP, 130, 5003). Classifications
were done with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). Redshifts
are derived from the broad SN features (two decimal points), and from narrow
SN features or host galaxy lines (three decimal points). Limits prior to
detection and current magnitudes are available on the Transient Name Server
(https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il).
