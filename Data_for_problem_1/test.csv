ATEL #11831,"
Following the report of a hard to soft accretion state transition (ATel
#11820) in the currently outbursting candidate black hole X-ray binary,
MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11399, #11400, #11404, #11406, #11418, #11420, #11440),
we performed target-of-opportunity observations with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA).
We last observed MAXI J1820+070 with both ALMA and the SMA on April 12.

ALMA observations were taken on 2018 April 12 between 08:12-10:36 UTC and
on 2018 July 6 between 01:31-06:18 UTC (MJD~58305.063-58305.262), in the
335.5-339.4 GHz and 347.5-351.5 GHz frequency bands. On April 12, the ALMA
flux density at 343 GHz was very bright, ~120 mJy. Highly preliminary quality
assurance checks on the July 6 observations detected MAXI J1820+070 with
peak flux densities of 7.2 mJy (near 03 UT) and 4.9 (near 05 UT) mJy at
a representative frequency of 343.5 GHz. We estimate that these preliminary
measurements have absolute fluxes only good to ~25%, but that the drop
in the flux density over two hours is likely real.  

SMA observations occurred on 2018 April 12 between 11:00-20:00 UT and on
2018 July 6 between 09:05 - 11:40 UTC (MJD=58305.378-58305.486). During
our observations, the two SMA receivers were tuned to local oscillator
frequencies of 223/231 GHz (April 12) and 223/275 GHz (July 6).  On April
12, the SMA flux density was ~100 mJy at 227 GHz (where the flux was highly
variable during the observation). Stacking the two frequency bands together
in the image plane on July 6, we detect a 3 sigma source coincident with
the position measured from our previous mm/sub-mm observations (ATel #11440).
Fitting a point source in the image plane we measure a preliminary flux
density of 2.6 +/-0.8 mJy at 249 GHz.  

We see clear evidence for reduced jet flux density values at mm/sub-mm
frequencies between April 12 and July 6 observations. Over this same time,
Swift/BAT only measured a moderate drop in hard X-rays (15-50 keV; 0.66+/-0.03
counts/cm^2/s on April 12 dropping to 0.21 +/-0.02 counts/cm^2/s on July
5/6 near 23:40 - 07:45 UTC). All measurements of the jets flux density
on July 6 are significantly fainter than that predicted by the standard
radio/X-ray correlation (f_r &prop; f_x^0.7) based on their April 12 values.
This strongly suggests that the radio jet was quenching on July 6 as the
hard intermediate - soft intermediate state transition occurred (ATel #11823).

Radio through mm/sub-mm detections of black hole X-ray binaries typically
arise from a compact synchrotron-emitting jet, characterized by a flat
to slightly inverted, optically thick spectrum, that can break to a steep,
optically thin spectrum at higher frequencies. The spectral break of the
jet has been seen to move to lower frequencies as the compact jet is quenched
during transitions to softer accretion states (e.g., Russell et al. 2014,
MNRAS, 439, 1390). The ALMA and SMA flux densities on July 6 are increasingly
more discrepant from those expected from the hard X-ray flux. Moreover,
the measurement of the early ALMA flux density is nearly simultaneous with
the recently reported ~6 mJy AMI detection towards the end of its monitoring
on July 5/6 (ATel #11827). Our best explanations for these data requires
that both the jet-power drop (relative to that expected from the accretion
rate) and that either: (a) the radio--sub-mm spectrum has transformed from
being inverted on April 12 to nearly flat on July 6 or (b) the spectral
break moved from above 350 GHz on April 12 to below 350 GHz (possibly to
frequencies below the SMA band) on July 6.  

We thank the SMA and ALMA staff for rapidly scheduling our observations.

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient. 

We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their
continued support of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation through grant GBMF5490 to the Ohio State University,

ATEL #11833,"		Hole, Transient

We report on near-infrared and optical photometry of the bright X-ray transient
MAXI J1820+070/ASASSN-18ey (ATel #11399, #11400, #11406, #11418, #11420,
, #11421, #11423, #11439, #11451, #11462, #11481), carried out with the
60-cm robotic telescope REM (La Silla, Chile). The source was reported
recently to be undergoing a fast spectral transition (#11820, #11823, #11827).

REM has been monitoring the target almost daily since 2018  Mar 22nd, observing
nearly simultaneously in optical (four simultaneous filters, g', r', i',
z') and near-infrared (cycling over three filters, J, H, K). The latest
three observations were carried out on 2018 July 2nd (from about 04:15
to 04:30 UT), 8th (03:33 - 03:46) and 9th (04:18 - 04:31), the gap being
due to bad weather in La Silla.  

The source is always detected in each single filter. Magnitudes were calibrated
against a number of standard stars in the field of view. Preliminary analysis
shows that the optical flux is roughly constant, with the griz magnitudes
being all around 13.3 +/- 0.13 during all observations. There is instead
clear evidence for a declining near-infrared flux, especially at the reddest
filter, with a K magnitude going from 11.82 +/- 0.18 on July 2nd to 12.38
+/- 0.12 on July 8th to 12.43 +/- 0.14 on July 9th. 

We assumed E(B-V)=0.163 (#11418) to deredden the observed magnitudes, obtaining
an inverted (optically thick) optical spectrum going from about 30 mJy
in g' to 20 mJy in z', with a spectral index of about 0.5. The spectrum
extended with a similar spectral index to the NIR regime, reaching a flux
of about 13 mJy in K, on July 2nd. On July 8th and 9th, while the optical
spectrum was observed to remain constant, the NIR spectrum steepened, showing
a z'-to-K spectral index of about 1 as the flux in the K filter reached
a flux of about 7 mJy. 

We note that these values must be taken with caution given the large current
uncertainties. Nevertheless, the rather smooth evolution of the magnitudes
in most filters seems to confirm the overall trend, which appears consistent
with a quenching of the compact jet during the state transition 

REM will continue to observe this target on a daily basis, weather allowing.
In particular, a long observation is scheduled for the upcoming Chilean
night, as REM is expected to stare at this source from 23:30 July 9th to
06:30 July 10th (UT). 

Multi-wavelength coverage is highly encouraged, especially but not only
at high high time resolution and/or at longer wavelengths than near-infrared.
People interested in coordinating can contact the authors or sign up to
SMARTNet (<a>www.isdc.unige.ch/smartnet</a>). 

We thank the REM team and especially Dino Fugazza for scheduling these
observations.

ATEL #11835,"
We provide an update to the most recent Swift observations of the Narrow-Line
Seyfert 1 galaxy 
Mkn 335 (RA-2000=00h06m19.5s, Dec-2000=+20d12m11s), which last week was
found in the dimmest flux 
ever in the UVW2 band (1923A) (Grupe et al., ATel #11815). 
Our new 1 ks Swift observation, this time carried out in all filters, was
performed 2018-July-08 starting at 17:26 UT. Mrk 335 remained at a very
low 0.3-10 keV flux at a level of (2.0+0.36-0.17)e-15 W m^-2 (or 2.6e-15
W m^-2,  after correction for Galactic absorption). The UVOT observations
confirmed the lowest optical-UV state every seen (since the beginning of
Swift monitoring) in all 6 filters, 
as listed below (magnitudes corrected for Galactic reddening, E(B-V)=0.035,
are given in parentheses): 
V=14.74+/-0.04 (14.62), B=15.06+/-0.04 (14.91), U=13.93+/-0.04 (13.72),

We would like to thank Brad Cenko for approving our ToO request and the
Swift team for promptly executing this observation. We will continue monitoring
Mkn 335 with Swift over the next two weeks.

ATEL #11826,"
We report continuing echelle spectroscopy of the newly discovered classical
nova TCP J18292290-1430460 = Nova Sct 2018 (ATel #11802, #11817).  Echelle
spectra were obtained 2018 Jul 7.85 UT (HJD 58307.4238)  at Observatoire
de la Tourbiere, France,  RC400 Astrosib-Eshel-ATIK460EX2018  with a resolution
of ~11000 covering 4250-7585, 10x1200 sec; the average S/N ~ 40 at 6000A.

The Na I D lines show two absorption features, -1500 km/s and -820 km/s,
with the higher velocity absorption stronger but approximately the same
velocity width. There is still strong emission in the line extending to
+2000 km/s. The Mg I triplet shows virtually the same profile as Na I but
the overlap of the multiplet components changes the absorption widths;
Na I 5686 may also be present. Fe II RMT 42 lines show two components of
unequal absorption strength (4923, -1600 km/s, 3.1A; -800, 1.3A; 5018,
2.2A,1.4A; 5169, 2.5A, 1.5A:) with the velocity widths 600 km/s and 400
km/s, respectively.  The emission wing is similarly extended to +200 km/s,
and structure is beginning to appear (double peak) at low velocity (-350,+500
km/s).  Si II 6347,6371 show almost identical absorption features as Fe
II but neither line shows emission.  Al II 6237 is possibly present, blended
with Fe II 6248, with weaker absorption but with a similar velocity extent
as Na I.  The Balmer lines show the same structures as Fe II with a broader
high velocity absorption component.  The same two peaks at low velocity
are present on Halpha and Hbeta, although less visible on Halpha; the emission
peak ratio is about 3.6; the spectra were normalized and uncorrected for
interstellar extinction. 

Although not displaying any emission component, He I 5876, 6678 show a
broad detached absorption feature at -1500 km/s (full width at continuum
~ 500 km/s).  This has been observed in several novae at this early stage,
notably V339 Del.  This feature is a broad absorption to the blue of the
Na I narrower features. 

Neither [O I] nor [N II] are visible.  The dominant emission lines are
still from singly ionized metals, few if any forbidden lines are present
(e.g. [Fe II] 5159 is absent) and the nova appears to be in a later stage
of the Fe-curtain with the recombination 

Several DIBSs are visible in this last spectrum, notably 5780A (EW ~ 0.63A),
5797A (0.33A), 6613A (0.32A).   

Observations are continuing, all spectra are publicly available though

ATEL #11828,"
MAXI/GSC observations of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 show that the X-ray
flux is nearly exponentially decreasing in the last >100 days. Currently,
the source is in the faintest state in the soft (< 10 keV) X-ray band in
the last 22 years of continuous monitoring with RXTE/ASM and MAXI/GSC.

The GSC spectrum obtained from 20:14 on 2018 July 7 (MJD 58306) to 13:17
July 8 is well described by an absorbed power-law model with a photon index
of 2.67 +/- 0.40 and a hydrogen  column density nH of (5.4 +/- 2.0)e22
atoms/cm2, or by an absorbed disk blackbody (diskbb) model with an inner
disk temperature of 2.2 +/- 0.4 keV and nH of (1.7 +/- 1.4)e22 atoms/cm2.
The absorbed 2-10 keV X-ray flux in the power-law fit is 2.4e-9 erg/s/cm2
(unabsorbed power-law model, 4.3e-9 erg/s/cm2). The hard X-ray flux observed
with Swift/BAT is also declining, but it is not the historically faintest
(https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/GRS1915p105/). We note
that the hard X-ray flux obtained with Swift/BAT and the 15-50 keV/ 2-10
keV ratios obtained with Swift/BAT and MAXI/GSC show an unusual negative
correlation, and the ratio is the highest ever.

The present source activity may be classified of class ""chi"" according
to the classification of variability by Belloni et al. (2000, A&A 355,
271), or is in a soft state shown by Ueda et al. (2009, ApJ 695, 888).
Continuous short-term variability study is required to confirm it.  
Peculiar properties of this source among black hole binaries are often
attributed to its high mass accretion rate. The long-term exponential decay
in X-ray flux just similar to other X-ray novae might suggest the end of
the outburst of this long-lived X-ray nova. We note, however, that such
declines were observed a few times previously and later the flux increased
again.

Thus, we encourage multi-wavelength observations to confirm the current
status of the source and to understand the anomalous nature of the microquasar
GRS 1915+105.

ATEL #11827,"
We report further (Atel #11420) observations of the black hole XRB candidate
MAXI J1820+070 with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA).
Observations were initiated after reports (ATels #11820, #11823) that the
source was rapidly undergoing a state transition. Data were taken at a
central frequency of 15.5 GHz, with J1824+1044 and 3C 286 used as the phase
and absolute flux calibrator respectively. Date were reduced using the
custom software pipeline REDUCE_DC (e.g. Davies et al. 2009, Perrott et
al. 2015). 

We observed the source intermittently between 18:31:41.4 and 03:05:32.5
(UTC) on 05-Jul-2018/06-Jul-2018, 19:51:31.3 and 04:52:18.9 (UTC) on 06-Jul-2018/07-Jul-2018
and 19:29:38.9 and 04:48:22.9 on 07-Jul-2018/08-Jul-2018. As variability
is expected in the radio emission during a state transition we calculate
a channel and baseline averaged UV-amplitude coefficient directly from
the UV data in 10 minute time intervals (note that there are no other sources
in the field). The flux density on the night of 05-July-2018 showed a significant
drop from our previous measurement on 02-Jul-2018, falling from ~40 mJy
to ~10 mJy. The source then continued to decline over the course of this
observation, ending at ~6 mJy. The following night (06-July-2018) we observe
a radio flare, with the flux density at the start of the night at ~15 mJy,
rising to ~40 mJy over a ~3.5 hour period, and then decaying back to ~15
mJy over ~4.5 hours, at which point the source was no longer observable.
On the final night of our observations (07-July-2018) we measure a flux
density of ~1.5 mJy and see no major variation over the course of the observation.

These observations, showing significantly quenched radio emission and
radio flaring, are consistent with the reports of a state transition by
the NICER team. 

We plan on continued monitoring of this source and would like to thank
the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory staff for carrying out these observations.

ATEL #11824,"
On Jun 9 and 10 we carried out the third observing run targeting the black
hole transient MAXI J1820+070 (ASASSN-18ey) with the fiber-fed fast optical
photon counter IFI+IQUEYE, mounted at the 1.2 m Galileo telescope in Asiago
(see ATel #11723 and other ATels referenced therein). 

Several observations were carried out between MJD 58278.041748 and 58278.079276
(Jun 9 01:00:07.0 UT through 01:54:09.4 UT) and between MJD 58278.881996
and 58279.083934 (Jun 9 21:10:04.5 UT through Jun 10 02:00:51.9 UT). We
retained only the observations with better sky conditions, for a total
useful on-source time of 4500s (4 observations taken on Jun 10). During
these observations the average background-subtracted source rate was 2900
c/s. The sky background was regularly monitored with acquisitions performed
between on-target observations and had an average rate of 1700 c/s. The
fractional root-mean-square (rms) variability of the 1s binned light curve
of the target was 4.2%. A nearby field star pointed in between on-target
observations showed a significantly lower rms (2.6%). 

Power spectra of the non-background subtracted light curves with a time
bin of 1 ms were computed for each night and were then averaged over intervals
of 65s duration. We detected two broad QPO-like features on the top of
a broad-band noise component (that were fitted with Lorentzians). The higher
frequency QPO-like feature has a centroid frequency of 268 +/- 12 mHz,
a full-width-half-maximum of 150 +/- 39 mHz, and a fractional root-mean-square
variability of 1.9 +/- 0.2 %. The lower frequency QPO is less significant
and has a centroid frequency of 151 +/- 6 mHz, a full-width-half-maximum
of 33 +/- 16 mHz, and a fractional root-mean-square variability of 1.2
+/- 0.3 %. We obtained acceptable fits of the power spectrum also with
two harmonically-related QPOs, that have width and significance similar
to those reported above. Acceptable fits are obtained for 1:2, 2:3, or
3:5 centroid frequency ratios. 

A fit with harmomically-related QPOs performed on the April IFI+Iqueye
observations (ATel #11723) gives similar results for the same harmonic
ratios (1:2, 2:3 or 3:5). We note also that, within the errors, the QPO
centroid frequencies of the June observations are two times higher than
those of the April observations. However, the 268 mHz QPO has a significantly
larger width than the 128 mHz QPO observed in April and its frequency is
not consistent with the fractional increment of the centroid frequency
reported in April.

ATEL #11823,"
Following the onset of a rapid state transition in the black hole transient
ASASSN-18ey/MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11820), NICER has been observing the
source with a very high cadence (see left panel in figure linked at the
end of this telegram). The new NICER observations show that in the past
24 hours, the 0.2-12 keV count rate (scaled to 52 active Focal Plane Modules)
has increased from ~41000 cts/s around July 5 22:00 UTC to 66000 cts/s
(>6 Crab in rate) around July 6 19:20 UTC. During this period the spectral
hardness decreased smoothly. 

The (type C) low-frequency QPO that we reported in ATel #11820 increased
in frequency from ~3.8 Hz on July 5 22:00 UTC to 6.4 Hz on July 6 11:45
UTC, while it significantly weakened. Around 14:45 UTC the QPO was only
marginally detected around 8 Hz, although its harmonic at ~16 Hz could
still be seen clearly.   

A rapid jump in count rate (from ~57000 cts/s to ~63000 cts/s) occurred
during the time interval of July 06 16:05-16:16 UTC. This sudden increase
in count rate was not accompanied by a strong change in hardness. However,
after the count rate jump a type-B QPO appeared in the power spectrum,
around 4.4 Hz. This type-B QPO was still present in our most recent observation
(July 6 19:20 UTC), but had decreased in frequency to 3.4 Hz.   

The power-spectral and spectral evolution suggest that the source has now
moved to the soft intermediate state.  This is confirmed by quantifying
the 5-10 keV power-spectral shape in terms of ratios between integrated
power in different frequency bands (see right panel in linked figure and
Heil et al. MNRAS, 448, 3339 (2015) for details), for comparison with black
hole transients observed by RXTE.  Based on past observations of transitions
between the hard and soft intermediate states in black hole transients,
we expect that significant evolution should be taking place in the radio
through optical, as the result of changes in the jet emission, including
the possible launching of ballistic jets (see Fender et al., MNRAS, 396,1370
(2009)).

We report X-ray observations of the microquasar Cyg X-3 during its gamma
ray bright state (as detected by AGILE, ATels #11804, 11814) with the X-ray
Timing Instrument (XTI) on the NICER X-ray observatory in the 0.4-12 keV
band. The NICER observations began on 2018-07-03 23:30:29.184 UT (orbital
phase = 0.423 according to the ephemeris of Bhargava et al. 2017, ApJ,
849, 141) and are continuing. NICER initially observed the source at a
count rate of 345 XTI counts/s, declining to 270 XTI counts/s within 38
minutes. The NICER observations show phase-dependent variability of approximately
a factor of 4 in count rate, from a maximum of 1069 counts/s to a minimum
of 252 counts/s.  

The spectrum shows significant line emission, especially between 1 and
7 keV. The spectrum can be simply approximated by a combination of an absorbed
power-law plus an absorbed thermal emission component. Sulfur line emission
near 2.6 keV is particularly strong, and the spectrum also shows strong
emission from the Fe K complex near 6.7 keV. The power-law component has
a photon index of approximately 1.2 with a column density of about 8e22/cm^2.
The thermal component has a temperature of 1-2 keV, with a somewhat lower
column (about 4e22/cm^2). The initial NICER observation had a flux of 8.4e-9
ergs/cm^2/s in the 0.4-12 keV band. 

A power spectrum of a portion of the initial NICER observation indicates
the appearance of a transient QPO near 140 Hz at a significance near the
4-sigma level. This QPO has not, however, been reliably detected again
in subsequent observations.

We have observed the position of AT2018cow (ATel #11727) with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) on 2018-06-28 from 08:30-14:00 UT at central
frequencies of 5.5 GHz, 9 GHz, 16.7 GHz and 21.2 GHz with a bandwidth of
2 GHz in each band, and 34 GHz with a bandwidth of 4 GHz. A point source
coincident with the location of AT2018cow (ATel #11727) is detected in
all bands. We report preliminary flux densities of:  

~0.22 mJy at 5.5 GHz;  
~0.52 mJy at 9 GHz;  
~1.5 mJy at 16.7 GHz;  
~2.3 mJy at 21.2 GHz;  
~7.6 mJy at 34 GHz.  

Analysis is ongoing and subsequent epochs are planned. A flux-density scale
error in our previous ATCA observations (ATel #11795) resulted in an incorrect
measurement being reported at 9 GHz. The corrected flux density of AT2018cow
at 9 GHz on 2018-06-26 is ~0.3 mJy.  

Thank you to CSIRO staff for supporting these observations.

We observed the transient source AT2018cow (ATel #11727) with e-MERLIN,
as part of the joint e-MERLIN/AMI-LA monitoring campaign, at a central
frequency of 5 GHz (with a bandwidth of 512 MHz) on July 03/04 2018. Only
four e-MERLIN stations have been used (Pi, Kn, De, Cm) and the resulting
image sensitivity is 31 microJy/beam rms. We detect radio emission from
AT2018cow at 5 GHz with a flux density of ~ 170 microJy. The position of
the radio source is at RA = 16h16m00.2244s, Dec = +22d16'04.890"" (J2000;
a few mas positional uncertainty). Future e-MERLIN observations are planned.

ATEL #11820,"
We report on ongoing NICER monitoring observations of the black hole transient
MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11399, #11400, #11418, #11423, #11420, #11426). 

Following a fast rise upon its discovery in March 2018 and an extended
hard state plateau, the 0.2-12 keV count rate of the source began a steady
decline in mid-May (see link below for light/hardness curves). A reversal
of this behavior was observed in mid-June. The NICER X-ray Timing Instrument
(XTI) showed a broad minimum (at ~5600 cts/s) yielding to an increase in
count rate, along with a softening of the spectrum. This increase and softening
have both been accelerating in the past week. On July 5 the average 0.2-12
keV count rate was ~34300 cts/s, up from ~9300 cts/s on June 27.  

Rapid evolution has also been seen in the power density spectra. The low-frequency
QPOs, which have been reported previously (ATel #11488, #11510  #11576,
#11578), have increased in frequency from ~0.35 Hz on June 27 to ~3.0 Hz
on July 5. To emphasize the rate of evolution, we note that the QPO frequency
doubled in less than 18 hours between the July 4 and 5 observations. 

The spectrum of the July 5 observation is reasonably well described by
an absorbed continuum model consisting of a disk component, a power law,
and reflection. The slope of the power law (~2.4) is considerably steeper
than during the hard state observations of the source (1.6-1.7, ATel #11576).
The unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV flux on July 5 was 9.8e-8 erg/cm^2/s. For a distance
of 3.2 kpc (Gandhi et al. 2018, arXiv:1804.11349) this corresponds to a
luminosity of 1.2e38 erg/s.  

The above behavior suggests that MAXI J1820+070 is currently in a hard
intermediate state and transitioning, at an unusually rapid rate, toward
the soft state. Since the soft state may already be reached within a few
days, NICER observations of the source are continuing at an intensive rate
and we strongly encourage observations at all wavelengths in the coming
days to follow this state transition in detail.

ATEL #11813,"
NuSTAR performed a follow-up ToO for the transient AT2018cow (ATel #11727)
starting on 2018-07-02 14:01:09 UTC under Director's Discretionary Time
(DDT, PI Margutti). During this observation we obtained roughly 30 ks of
exposure time spanning from roughly 16.2 to 16.8 days post discovery. 

AT2018cow is still clearly detected in excess of background up to ~50 keV,
although we see a drop in the total flux compared to the previous NuSTAR
observation (ATEL #11775). The spectrum can be described by a single simple
power-law fit across the 3-50 keV bandpass with a power-law index of 1.39
+/- 0.02 and a 3-79 keV flux of 3.2e-11 ergs / cm2 / sec. This is slightly
softer than we observed during the first NuSTAR epoch. 

For comparison with our previous results, we find a 15-79 keV flux for
the model describe above to be ~2.4e-11 ergs / cm2 / sec, or roughly 20%
fainter than we previously measured. 

From our analysis of 3.6 ks of Swift XRT observations obtained during the
second NuSTAR epoch we find that the spectrum can be well fit with a single
power-law model with a power-law index of 1.42 +\- 0.07 (all errors are
1-sigma). We note that this is harder than the Swift XRT spectrum we reported
during the observation obtained during the first seven days, which had
a power-law index of 1.60 +/- 0.03. 

A joint Swift/NuSTAR fit shows that the spectrum can now be modeled by
a single power-law component across the 0.3-50 keV band-pass. We no longer
see any evidence requiring a second, prominent, hard power-law component
at high energies, which was previously detected by NuSTAR and INTEGRAL
(ATel #11775 and #11788). 

We thank the entire NuSTAR team for arranging these observations.

After the recent gamma-ray detection (ATel #11804), AGILE is detecting
a prolonged gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV from a source positionally
consistent with the microquasar Cygnus X-3. A preliminary multi-source
likelihood analysis detects a peak gamma-ray flux F(>100 MeV) = (4.7 +/-
1.7) x 10^-6 photons/cm^2/s, integrating from 2018-07-02 UT 06:00:00 to
2018-07-04 UT 06:00:00. 

The system is faint/undetected in the hard X ray band (Swift/BAT, 15-50
keV, count rate < 0.02 cts/cm^2/s) and shows a flickering activity at radio
wavelengths (ATel #11805), which could represent a precursor (""hypersoft""
state, Koljonen et al., 612, A27, 2018) of an incoming giant radio outburst.

The AGILE-GRID detection was obtained while AGILE is observing in spinning
mode, surveying a large fraction of the sky each day. The source can be
monitored with the public mobile application ""AGILEScience"" developed by
the AGILE Team, available for both Android and iOS devices. 

Multifrequency observations of Cygnus X-3 are strongly encouraged.

galaxy Mkn 335 (RA-2000=00h06m19.5s, Dec-2000=+20d12m11s) in its lowest
ultra-violet flux state ever seen, since the beginning of our Swift monitoring.
We have started monitoring Mkn 335  with Swift in May 2007 (Grupe et al.
2007, 2012) when it was caught in a very low X-ray flux state, and we have
followed it ever since. In our most recent Swift observation on 2018-July-02,
10:00 (UT), 
we found it in the UVOT W2 filter at 14.15+/-0.04 mag which corresponds
to an uncorrected flux of (2.25+/-0.09)e-14 W m^-2 (Galactic reddening
E(B-V) = 0.035 in the direction of Mkn 335, resulting in 13.86 mag and
2.9e-14 W m^-2). This is even about 20% lower than the previous deep UV
low state in December 2015 (Grupe et al. 2015, Atel #8477; Gallo et al.
2018, MNRAS 478, 2557). The X-ray flux also remains very low, with (1.7+/-0.2)e-15
W m^-2 in the 0.3-10 keV band.

0.47-2.5 microns using the VNIRIS spectrograph on the Aerospace Corporation's

gas was dominated by lines of H I, C I, N I, O I, Ca II, and Na I, He I

July 1 spectrum of Gard and Sollecchia.  That change, plus, Nova Scuti's
comparatively broad lines for a Fe II type nova (1800 km/sec for Paschen
Beta and Brackett Gamma), suggest that the spectrum is evolving fairly
rapidly.   The relative strengths of the O I lines at 0.8446, 1.1287, and

Compared with the limiting magnitudes due to our small telescope, the source
was very faint, nevertheless a decreasing flux density for increasing wavelengths
is recognizable; such a trend is more typical of cataclysmic variables
(Hoard et al. 2014 ApJ, 786, 68) than of young eruptive variables (Lorenzetti
et al. 2012, ApJ, 749,188). Hence, we confirm the later adjustment provided
by ASAS-SN team (""spectrum taken suggests this object is a CV"") aimed at
correcting their automatic classification. 
Moreover, the position of ASAS-SN-18mw (far from known star-forming region)
is a further indication that this source is probably not a YSO.

We continue the  daily monitoring of the microquasars with the RATAN-600
radio telescope and we confirm the increase of activity of microquasar
Cygnus X-3, detected with AGILE by Piano at al. (ATel #11804) at >100 MeV.
From  1 to 2 July (MJD 58299.966 to 58300.964) the fluxes increased in
4-8 times 
at 4.7, 8.2 and 11.2 GHz. Thus it occurred just after (~1 day) the gamma-ray
event detected by AGILE.  
The spectrum on 2 July  is well fitted by the power law:  
S[mJy] = 130frequency^(+0.66)[GHz] from 2.3 to 30 GHz.  Such high fluxes
from Cygnus X-3 at the  higher frequencies have been detected in the fist
time from April 2017. This flaring event is associated with the almost
total ""nulling"" of the Swift/BAT 15-50 keV flux. According to recent giant
flares (ATel #9416, #9444, #9501, #10126) of Cygnus X-3 in 2016 and 2017
we can propose that the microquasar entered in a ultra-soft X-ray state
(Koljonen et al., 2010) with coming quench of radio emission, and after
which a giant flare  (>5 Jy) can most probably occur. Thus the current
flaring event could be a precursor of a next bright flare, similar to two
flares detected in September 2016 and April 2017 (Trushkin et al., 2017,
Koljonen et al., 2018).

event coincident with the position of 2FHL J1037.6+5710, a BL Lac object
located at (RA, Dec) = (159.414, 57.172) degrees in J2000 coordinates.
This event was detected by the HAWC real-time flare monitor (ApJ 843, 116)
and has an associated false alarm rate of 0.02 events per year. The corresponding
significance of this event has been steadily increasing since UTC 2018-06-29
21:59:00 and reached its present maximum value at UTC 2018-07-01 21:03:18.
Although the source is located at an unfavorable declination for HAWC,
the low false alarm rate suggests potentially strong VHE transient activity.
HAWC will continue to monitor this source. Multiwavelength observations
to clarify the nature of the activity are encouraged.

HAWC is a TeV gamma ray water Cherenkov array located in the state of Puebla,

We report the independent discovery of an apparent nova in M31 on a co-added
1710-s R-band CCD frame taken on 2018 Jun. 30.032 UT with the 0.65-m telescope
at Ondrejov. 

The object was independently discovered also by K. Itagaki (designated
as PNV J00414889+4109148) <ALIGN=CENTER><EM><A HREF=""http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/unconf/followups/J00414889+4109148.html"">see

The object was designated by us as M31N 2018-06c and is located at R.A.
= 0h41m48s.91, Decl. = +41o09'14"".2 (equinox 2000.0), 
which is 625.3"" west and 414.3"" south of the center of M31 (see link to
discovery 
image below). 

The following R-band magnitudes were obtained using the 0.65-m telescope
at Ondrejov:

We report on a preliminary search for >100 MeV gamma-ray emission from
AT2018cow (ATel #11727) with data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT).
During the ~1 week interval from 2018 June 19.5 - 26.0 when the position
of the optical transient was within the LAT field of view, we found no
significant >100 MeV gamma-ray emission with a 95% confidence flux upper
limit of <3.5 x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1. Moreover, during the 1-day interval
of the reported NuSTAR detection (June 23, ATel #11775), we found no significant
emission with a >100 MeV flux upper limit of <8 x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1.

Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray
monitoring of this source will continue. For this source the Fermi LAT
contact persons are D. Kocevski (e-mail: daniel.kocevski at nasa.gov) and
C.C. Cheung (Teddy.Cheung at nrl.navy.mil). 

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

We report results from offline analysis of data from Astrosat CZTI from
last confirmed non-detection 2018-06-13 04:07 UTC (ATel #11738) to detection
time 2018-06-16 10:35 UTC (ATel #11727), to look for any coincident hard
X-ray flash. CZTI is a coded aperture mask instrument that has considerable
effective area for about 29% of the entire sky, but is also sensitive to
brighter transients from the entire sky.  

After removing orbit-wise background variation in data, we binned the data
in 0.1s, 1s, and 10s bins to search for coincident spikes in the count
rates in the four independent, identical detector quadrants. We selected
confidence levels such that the probability of a false trigger in one AstroSat
orbit window (~6000s) is 10^-4. We do not find evidence for any hard X-ray
transient in this window corresponding to AT2018cow, in the CZTI energy
range of 20-200 keV. 

Using the position (RA, Dec) = (244.00090, 22.26800) as provided in Smartt
et al. (ATel #11727), a detailed mass model of the AstroSat satellite to
calculate the instrument response in this direction and assuming a power
law with alpha = -1.0 for the spectrum, we get the following upper limits
for source flux in the 20-200 keV band: 
0.1 s: flux = 6.3e-6 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 
1.0 s: flux = 9.8e-7 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 
10.0 s: flux = 1.5e-7 ergs cm^-2 s^-1  

CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including
VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation
funded, managed and facilitated the project.

AT2018cow: MAXI GSC data search 

We investigated MAXI/GSC all-sky survey data of AT2013cow, discovered 
on 2016-06-15 (MJD 58284) (ATEL#11727).  Since 2016-05-01 to 
2016-06-14T05 (MJD 58283.21), the source sky position of (RA, 
Dec)=(244.00090, 22.26800) had been scanned with good GSC units in the

normal-operation mode.  After that time, it has been covered by the 
GSC_#3 unit, which has a problem in the veto function for the 
anti-coincidence background cut.  We have not found any significant 
emission on the source location.  Because the backgrounds of the 
GSC_#3 are higher by an order of magnitude than those of the normal 
GSCs, the sensitivity got worse by a factor of 4-5.  The 3-simga upper

limit on the 2-20 keV source flux for each scan transit from 
2016-06-14 (MJD 58283) to 2016-06-16 (MJD 58286) is listed in the

ATEL #11804,"		Hole, Transient

AGILE is detecting gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV from a source positionally
consistent with the microquasar Cygnus X-3, at (l, b) = (79.4, 1.1) +/-
0.9 (stat) +/- 0.1 (syst). Integrating from 2018-06-29 UT 11:00:00 to 2018-07-01
UT 11:00:00, a preliminary multi-source likelihood analysis detects a gamma-ray
flux F(>100 MeV) = (2.6 +/- 1.2) x 10^-6 photons/cm^2/s. 

Hard X-ray emission from the microquasar is at a very-low/undetectable
level (Swift/BAT, 15-50 keV; http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/CygX-3/).

As previously detected, this X-ray spectral state may precede plasmoid
ejection (Tavani et al., Nature, 462, 620, (2009); Abdo et al., Science,
326, 1512 (2009); Piano et al., A&A, 545, A110 (2012)). Therefore, Cygnus
X-3 might produce radio flares in the next few days. 

We strongly encourage multi-frequency observations of Cygnus X-3.

ATEL #11803,"
We report detections of an infrared counterpart to AT 2018akh in Spitzer/IRAC
3.6 and 4.5 micron images ([3.6] and [4.5]) of M81 taken as part of the
Spitzer InfraRed Intensive Transient Survey (SPIRITS; <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...839...88K"">Kasliwal
et al. 2017</a>). The transient, recovered by our automated transient detection
pipeline and designated SPIRITS 18dq, was first reported as a possible
nova by Z. Xu and X. Gao (<a href=""https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018akh"">see
here</a>), and subsequently by Kucakova et al. (ATEL #11465). Here, we
list our photometry (Vega mag) of the source, and pre-outburst limits from
non-detections: 

UT Date       | MJD      | [3.6] (error) | [4.5] (error) 
2017-06-23.71 | 57927.71 | >18.6         | >18.3 
2018-02-04.26 | 58153.26 |   ...         | >18.3 
2018-06-19.84 | 58288.84 |  17.8 (0.1)   |  16.92 (0.06) 

Assuming a distance modulus for M81 of 27.8 mag (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AJ....146...86T"">Tully
et al. 2013</a>), the absolute magnitude at [4.5] is -10.9 mag. The bright
IR detections reported here (cf. the optical peak at R = 20.5 mag on 2018-03-16.88;
ATEL #11465) suggest either a dust-forming nova or a luminous red nova,
especially given the relatively late phase at 95 days post peak.  

We examined the location of the transient in the archival Spitzer/IRAC
channels 1-4 Super Mosaics. There is no source coincident with the transient
position to [3.6] > 18.85 mag, [4.5] > 18.79 mag, [5.8] > 17.37 mag, [8.0]
16.46 mag. We also examined the HST WFC3/UVIS (F336W, F438W, F555W, F625W,
F814W) and IR (F105W, F125W, F160W) images taken in 2011-2012. To obtain
a precise position, we registered the Spitzer/IRAC [4.5] image of the transient
from 2018-06-19 with the F814W image. We find no candidate progenitor star
at the location of SPIRITS 18dq (AT 2018akh) to F814W > 25.7 mag (-2.1
mag absolute). Similarly, there is no obvious progenitor candidate in any
of the other HST/WFC3 frames covering the position.

ATEL #11799,"
We report the search results of AT2018cow (Smartt et al., ATel #11727)
in the Insight-HXMT/HE data. At T0 (2018-06-16 10:35:02 UTC), the source
location (RA=244.00090, Dec=22.26800) was covered by Insight-HXMT/HE without
occultation by the Earth.  

Within T0 +/- 100s, no significant detections (SNR>5) are found in a search
of the Insight-HXMT/HE raw light curves with time bins of 0.1s and 1s,
respectively. Assuming a typical GRB Band spectral (alpha=-1.9, beta=-3.7,
Epeak=70 keV), the 3-sigma upper limit for the source flux is 7.7e-8 ergs/cm^2/s
(0.2-5 MeV, incident energy).  

All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the
regular mode with the energy range of about 80-800 keV (record energy).
Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate the
spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside of the
telescope. 

Insight-HXMT is the first Chinese space X-ray telescope, which was funded
jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information about it could be found at

We report a new flare of the source of maser radio emission in the H2O
line at 22.235 GHz IRAS 16293-2422. The source is associated with a young
stellar system at a distance of about 140 pc (S.A. Dzib et al. 2018, A&A
614, A20). Observations were carried out at the 22-meter radio telescope
in Pushchino, Russia. The spectrum contains a strong single peak at VLSR=1.6-1.7
km/s. During June 2018 its flux density doubled. The history of its flux
density variations in 2018 is: Feb 27 - 230 Jy; Mar 13 - 271 Jy; Apr 24
- 2405 Jy; May 31 - 4723 Jy; Jun 25 - 9043 Jy; Jun 27 - 8878 Jy. The PDF
graphs of the line profile can be downloaded from the indicated link. The
source strongly flared several times since 1999, when we began to monitor
it. Previous results (together with its OH observations) were reported
by P. Colom et al. 2016, Astron. Reports 60, 730.

We report on Swift/XRT observations of the optical transient AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn
(ATel #11727).  
Observations of the target taken on 29 June 2018 showed an increase in
the X-ray flux compared to previous observations (ATel #11761), reaching
a maximum flux of 1.8 +/- 0.7 e-11 erg/s/cm2 when we fit an absorbed power
law model using wilm abundances (Wilms et al. 2000) and vern cross-sections
(Verner et al. 1996) to the X-ray spectrum in the 0.3-10 keV energy band.
The photon index at that flux was 1.2 +/- 0.8 and nh = 1.1 +/- 49.2 e20
cm-2. The most recent Swift observations, performed on 30 June 2018 (17:17:14-17:39:53
UT), suggest that the object has faded to a minimum X-ray flux of 6.05
+/- 1.32 e -12 erg/s/cm2 with nh=6.9 +/- 11.6 e20 cm-2 and photon index=1.7
+/- 0.4. 

More Swift observations are planned. We thank the Swift team for approving
and executing our ToO.

We report early low and echelle spectroscopy of the newly discovered transient
TCP J18292290-1430460 (AAVSO Alert 621695, discovered by Yukio Sakurai
on 2018 Jun 29.577UT)  The observations confirm this as a classical nova.
Echelle spectra were obtained by Olivier Garde (Observatoire de la Tourbiere,
France, RC400 Astrosib-Eshel-ATIK460EX2018)Jun  Jun 30.861UT (R ~11000),
covering 4250-7585, 10x1200 sec); the average S/N > 50 at 6000A.  Low resolution
grim spectra were obtained by  Umberto Sollecchia (L'Aquila, Italy; Alpy600,
R~ 500, 3769-7288A, 5x960 sec exposure time), centered at 2018 Jun 30.874UT.
The overall appearance of the spectrum is of strong, overlapping absorption
features with few prominent emission lines (aside from Halpha) and high
interstellar extinction.  However, there are some notable features that
warrant reporting.  P Cyg structure is present on Fe II 6456, 5169, 4923,
5018 (the usual), v_max = -800 km/s, nearly symmetric absorption and emission
in higher multiplets.  Hbeta shows deep absorption but no emission, Halpha
displays very strong emission (em/abs ~1) with an unsaturated (ejecta-like)
absorption extending to -1700 km/s (similarly for the red wing).  No He
I lines are present in the spectrum at this stage.  The optical Mg I triplet
(5167,72,83) shows displaced absorption at the same velocity as Na I D1,D2,
about -700 km/s, with the Na I D lines well separated even in the displaced
components.  There appears to be weak associated emission at Na I; the
ISM absorption is at about +20 km/s (several components seem to be present,
the lines are not completely saturated).  Mg II is absent.  The Si II 6347,71
doublet shows weak P Cyg, v_max=-800 km/s on both components.  There are
many overlapping absorption transitions, the spectrum is typical of a classical
nova in the optically thick (Fe-curtain) stage.  Overall, the reality of
the individual features is  confirmed with the low resolution Alpy600 spectrum
taken almost simultaneously.  Observations are continuing, all spectra
are publicly available though the ARAS database http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/Aras_DataBase/Novae/2018_NovaSct2018.htm

frequencies of 5.5 GHz, 9 GHz with a bandwidth of 2 GHz in each band, and

From T-T0 ~ 4-6.5 days the source has faded by ~0.17mag/day and then tends
to fade at a much slower rate: ~0.04mag/day from ~6.5 to 11 days after
T0. (T0 is the ATLAS2018qnn trigger time MJD 58285.441 == 2018-06-16 10:35:02

ATEL #11798,"
The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) Bright Transient Survey
(BTS; ATel #11688) reports classifications of the following targets. Spectra
have been obtained with the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM)
(range 350-950nm, spectral resolution R~100) mounted on the Palomar 60-inch
(P60) telescope (Blagorodnova et. al. 2018, PASP, 130, 5003). Classifications
were done with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). Redshifts
are derived from the broad SN features (two decimal points), and from narrow
SN features or host galaxy lines (three decimal points). Limits prior to
detection and current magnitudes are available on the Transient Name Server
(https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il).

ATEL #11791,"
MAXI/GSC confirmed the X-ray brightening from the Be/X-ray binary pulsar
Cep X-4(= 4U2135+57 and Ginga 2138+56) reported by Jenke et al. (2018,
Atel#11780).  The latest one-day averaged X-ray flux in 4-10 keV band reached
0.055 &plusmn 0.015 ph/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (48 &plusmn 13 mCrab) on 2018-06-27
(MJD 58296).  Due to the Cep X-4 region was out of FOV until 2018-06-24
(MJD 58293), the onset of this outburst was not able to be observed by
MAXI/GSC.  The 15-50 keV data obtained by BAT onboard the Neil Gehrels
Swift observatory indicated that the current outburst started from 2018-06-20
(MJD 58289).  Assuming that the present outburst traces the same profile
of the previous outbursts in 2009 (Atel #1956, #1972) and 2014 (Atel #6212,
#6243, #6265), the maximum flux is expected to be around 2018-07-03 (MJD
58301).  Orbital ephemeris have not been reported on this source.  Therefore,
we can not categorize this event as a normal outburst or a giant one. 
We encourage multiwavelength observations to reveal the nature of this
source.

ATEL #11792,"
The HAWC observatory did a follow up regarding a bright transient spatially
coincident with CGCG 137-068 (60 Mpc) named ATLAS18qqn (AT2018cow) reported
on ATel #11727 <br/> 
<br/> 
Considering the dates reported by the Palomar Observatory in ATel#11738
on 2018-06-13 and by NuSTAR in ATel #11775 for the observations in the
X-Ray band on 2018-06-23, we performed a search at the location of the
observed transient, (RA, Dec) = (244.000, 22.268) deg, for the time period
defined by the dates mentioned above. We did not see a significant detection
and we report daily upper limits at 95%CL as follows: <br/> 
<br/> 
Flux Normalization at 1 TeV ( x10^-11 TeV^-1 cm^-2 s^-1 ): <br/> 
2018-06-13: 2.11  <br/>

<br/> 
All flux normalization limits are obtained from a maximum likelihood fit
under the assumption of a fixed spectral shape with power law index of
-2.63. <br/> 
<br/> 
We also performed a search for transients in short timescales of 0.2s,
1s and 10s at the same location from 2018-06-13 04:07:45 UTC to 2018-06-16
10:35:02 (a total of 23.6hrs in our field of view). The time period was
constrained by the Palomar 48-inch observations in ATel #11738 and the
initial detection by ATLAS in ATel #11727. <br/> 
<br/> 
We found one sub-threshold candidate of ~5 sigma pre-trials in the 1 second
search and centered at 2018-06-13 05:10:01.30 UTC. This corresponds to
a false alarm rate consistent with background of ~1e-2 hr^-1. For a 1s
burst as nearby as CGCG 137-068 (z=0.014), and assuming a spectral index
of -2, HAWC has a 5 sigma sensitivity from 1e-7 photons/cm^2 to 1e-6 photons/cm^2
above 100GeV, depending on the zenith angle. <br/> 
<br/> 
The HAWC contact people for this analysis are Jose Andres Garcia-Gonzalez
(jagarcia@fisica.unam.mx), Magdalena Gonzalez (magda@astro.unam.mx) and
Israel Martinez (imc@umd.edu). <br/>

HAWC is a TeV gamma ray water Cherenkov array located in the state of Puebla,
Mexico, that monitors two thirds of the sky every day with an instantaneous
field of view of ~2 sr.

"
ATEL #11793,"
We report the search results of gamma-ray emission from AT2018cow in the
Fermi GBM data. Using the position (RA, Dec) = (244.00090, 22.26800) from
Smartt et al. (ATel #11727) we searched for impulsive events from the last
non-detection on June 13th (ATeL #11738) until the end of June 16th. During
this time period the sky position was observed by GBM 54% of the time.
GBM was not observing the source at the times of the spatially consistent
IceCube neutrinos (ATel #11785).  

During this time range there were 5 on-board triggers, 3 of which were
due to GRBs and the blind untargeted search of GBM data identified 4 additional
GRB candidates in the time range. None of these transients are consistent
with the source position of AT2018cow. We also performed dedicated sub-threshold
searches. Both a custom run of the blind untargeted search and the GBM
targeted search (traditionally run around gravitational wave triggers)
identified a number of transients that are either before the 13th or statistically
insignificant.  We list those that are spatially consistent (with large
uncertainties) here for completeness. 

1. The untargeted search identified a 64ms signal at 2018-06-12 06:40:53.5.
This is about a day before the last optical non-detection. 
2. The untargeted search identified a 0.7 s long signal at 2018-06-16 00:04:45.4
but this may be due to background fluctuations. 
3. The targeted search identified a ~2s long soft signal at 2018-06-12
14:30:22.5, before the last optical non-detection. 
4. The targeted search identified a ~8s long, soft signal at 2018-06-14
23:06:13.3. 
5. The targeted search identified a ~2s long, soft signal at 2018-06-15
at 02:10:47.8. 

All events identified by the targeted search are close in time to Earth
occultations of Sco X-1, and their sky localizations are also consistent
with the position of Sco X-1. For this reason, and considering their weakeness
compared to the GBM background, these events do not constitute strong evidence
for activity related to AT2018cow. 

If there was an impulsive gamma-ray signal at event time it is either one
of these candidate transients, or it occurred while GBM was not observing
the position of AT2018cow. Otherwise, we set impulsive upper limits of
~few x 10^-7 erg/s/cm^2 in the 10-1000 keV energy range for the times we
were observing the event. At a distance of 60 Mpc and assuming a soft spectrum
represented by a Band function with (alpha, beta, Epeak) of (-1.9, -3.7,
70 keV) this corresponds to an upper limit of ~few x 10^49 erg/s in the
1 keV - 10 MeV energy range. 

We also searched for longer-term gamma-ray emission using the Earth Occultation
Technique. There are a few spurious detections likely caused by confusion
with Sco X-1, but nothing consistent with the flux expected from the spectrum
measured by NuSTAR (ATel #11775) or the possible detection in Swift/BAT
(ATel #11782). 

We will continue to perform searches of the GBM data for this transient.
We acknowledge the Max Planck Gesellschaft and the Atlas cluster computing
team at AEI Hannover for part of the computations required by this analysis.

ATEL #11786,"
We report on the UVOT data collected during the Neil Gehrels Swift observation,
carried out on 2018 June 24 (ATel #11783) after the INTEGRAL discovery
of an enhanced hard X-ray emission from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1566 (ATel
#11754). 

In the UV band, a clear brightening of the point-like core of the Galaxy
is visible compared to archival observations. The estimated UVW2 magnitude
from the 2018 observation is  12.48, with an associated statistical (systematic)
uncertainty of 0.01 (0.03) mag. Archival observations of NGC 1566 in the
same filter were carried out on 2012 December 9 and 2015 August 9. The
estimated VEGA magnitude for the 2012 observation was 15.35, with an associated
statistical (systematic) uncertainty of 0.02 (0.03) mag.  The 2015 observation
gave compatible results to within the uncertainties with respect to the
2012 observation. 

We also report for completeness that the AB magnitudes of NGC 1566 measured
in 2018 and 2012 were 14.21 (associated statistical and systematic uncertainties
of 0.01 mag and 0.03 mag) and 17.08 (associated statistical and systematic
uncertainties of 0.02 mag and 0.03 mag), respectively. 

The 2012 and 2018 UVOT images are visible at <a href=""https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1298992"">this

ATEL #11787,"
Swift J1909.3+0115, also known as J1909.3+0124 
in the Swift-BAT 105-month survey (Oh, et al. 2018, ApJS 235, 4), 
was observed six times by the Swift XRT between 
2017 November 24 and 2018 March 7.  In each observation, a variable 
X-ray source was detected coincident with a bright optical counterpart
at 
(J2000.0) R.A. = 19h 09m 20.906s, decl. = +01d 12' 24.56"", 
&#960; = 1.414 &#177; 0.028 mas (Gaia DR2 position and parallax). 
Its maximum 0.3-10 keV count rate is ~0.15 s<sup>-1</sup>, with 
an average about half that.  Several of these images are 
contaminated by scattered X-rays from Aql X-1. 
The Swift-BAT source was also identified with 
XMMSL2 J190921.2+011225 and suggested to be Galactic by 
Stephen et al. 2018, ATel #11341.  ROSAT X-ray detections 
are 1RXS J190923.2+011154 and 1WGA J1909.3+0112; evidently 
these are all the same object. 

On 2018 March 4 we obtained a spectrum covering 3965-6875 &#197; 
using the Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph (OSMOS) on the 2.4-m Hiltner

telescope of the MDM Observatory.  Typical of a cataclysmic variable, 
bright emission lines of H, He I, He II, and the C III/N III Bowen blend

are present, together with (more rarely seen) photospheric 
absorption features of an early K-type companion star. 

Using the 1.3-m McGraw-Hill telescope at MDM, we obtained V-band time-series

photometry on eight nights between 2018 March 16 and June 15. 
Six of these runs were 3-5 hours long at 33 s cadence.  Flickering with

full amplitude of ~0.2 mag was seen, but no coherent period was detected.

Among these nights the mean magnitude ranged from V = 14.1 to 15.0. 

We obtained 20 more spectra with modspec on the 1.3-m between 
2018 May 9 and 13, another 20 with the 2.4-m and OSMOS 
on May 20 and 21, and five with modspec on the the 2.4-m on June 5 and
7. 
The emission-line strength varies dramatically.  The emission equivalent
width 
of H&alpha; falls mostly in the range 15 to 25 &#197;, but it was as high

as 43 &#197; in the discovery spectrum on March 4, and as low as 2 &#197;

for some of our June data.  In the latter spectra no other emission 
lines are detected. 

The radial velocities of the absorption spectrum show a sinusoidal 
(almost certainly orbital) modulation at a period of 2.06(2) days 
with a semi-amplitude K = 107(4) km s<sup>-1</sup>. This period is 
unusually long for a cataclysmic binary and requires that the companion

be somewhat evolved if it fills its Roche lobe. 
The Gaia DR2 distance is nominally 707 &#177; 14 pc, and the reddening

maps of Green et al. (2018, MNRAS 478, 651) give E(B-V) = 0.40 at this

distance.  From our spectrophotometry we estimate V = 15.5 for the 
companion star, which implies an absolute magnitude near +5 for the 
companion alone, more luminous than a main-sequence star 
of its early K spectral type. 

"
ATEL #11788,"
INTEGRAL is performing a public target of opportunity observation of the
transient AT2018cow (ATel #11727) since 2018-06-22 18:38 UTC. We report
here on the first 307 ks of on-source time taken until 2018-06-27 04:58
UTC. 

The source is detected by IBIS/ISGRI at a signal to 
noise ratio of 7.2 in the 30-100 keV range. The IBIS/ISGRI spectrum can
be 
described with a power law with photon index &Gamma;=1.7&plusmn;0.6 and
20-100 keV flux 6 &plusmn;2 &times; 10<sup>-11</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>
(uncertainties at 90% confidence level in the whole telegram).  

We note that the NuSTAR spectrum above 15 keV give a hard power law with
photon index &Gamma;=0.5  (ATel #11775), which is not consistent with the
INTEGRAL spectrum, as described above. Therefore, we determined an average
broad-band high-energy spectrum by combining the data of AT2018cow as measured
by Swift/XRT (22-25 June, see also ATel #11739), NuSTAR (23 June, ATel
#11775), and INTEGRAL/IBIS/ISGRI (22-27 June). To account for source variability,
we leave the intercalibration constant between the instruments as a free
parameter. The broad-band spectrum can be well fit with a broken power
law with exponential cutoff at high energy.  

The best-fit model parameters are the following:

A plot of the unfolded spectrum with residuals can be found at <a href=""https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1299242""
target=""_blank"">this link</a>. Residuals at 7-10 keV in the NuSTAR spectrum
are present, but their discussion is beyond the scope of this communication.

To estimate the significance of the high-energy cutoff, we jointly model
only the NuSTAR and INTEGRAL spectra above the power-law break, i.e., we
limited NuSTAR data above E> 15 keV. If we use a simple power law, we obtain
&chi;<sup>2</sup>/d.o.f. = 86.9/64; if we add a cutoff, we obtain &chi;<sup>2</sup>/d.o.f.
= 64.2/63. An F-test yields a significance of 4.3&sigma; for the presence
of a spectral cutoff (i.e., the probability that the &chi;<sup>2</sup>
improvement is due to chance is 1.3&times;10<sup>-5</sup>). More observations
are planned and they might improve the significance of this detection.

ATEL #11789,"
We obtained optical linear spectropolarimetry of AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn (Smartt
et al., ATel #11727) on four successive nights with the Bok 2.3 m telescope
on Kitt Peak (+ SPOL CCD Imaging/Spectropolarimeter; range 400 - 755 nm,
resolution 2.5 nm), as part of the Supernova Spectropolarimetry Project
(SNSPOL; http://grb.mmto.arizona.edu/~ggwilli/snspol/ ).  We measure the
following median values of the polarization (""p"") and polarization angle
(""t"") across the 430 - 740 nm spectral range: 

Epoch  UT Date        p(%)  t(deg) 
1      2018-06-21.36  0.75  147    
2      2018-06-22.35  1.04  124    
3      2018-06-23.32  0.38  120    
4      2018-06-24.33  0.33  121   

From multiple observations obtained on the same night, we estimate a 1-sigma
uncertainty in p of ~0.1%; the resulting uncertainty in t is approximately
5 degrees for the first two epochs and ~10 degrees for the final two epochs.
The polarization at all epochs presents a smooth variation with wavelength
to within statistical uncertainties (~0.5% per resolution element).  The
first two epochs are noteworthy for a marked increase in polarization redward
of ~630 nm, with both epochs' polarization rising to values approaching
~2% at 755 nm, the long-wavelength limit of our observations.  This rise
is absent in the third and fourth epochs, which present a flat polarization
level across the entire spectral range. 

It is possible that some (constant) component of the observed polarization
at all epochs is due to linear dichroism (directional extinction) produced
by interstellar dust grains along the line-of-sight in either the Milky
Way or CGCG 137-068, the presumed host galaxy of AT2018cow.  To test for
Milky Way interstellar polarization, we observed the distant Galactic star
BD+22 2949 (~5 arcmin from the line-of-sight to AT2018cow), and measure
its polarization to be p = 0.37%, t = 115 degrees.  The similarity of this
value to our final observations of AT2018cow (i.e., ""Epochs 3 & 4"") raises
the possibility that much of those epochs' observed polarization is indeed
not intrinsic to the object, but is instead produced by interstellar Galactic
dust.  However, the temporal polarization (and, polarization angle) changes
that are seen between individual epochs, as well as the unusual polarization
behavior exhibited at red wavelengths during the first two epochs, imply
an intrinsic polarization component to AT2018cow at least during the first
two epochs. 

The standard interpretation of an intrinsic continuum polarization signal
is that it stems from a departure from symmetry of the object's electron-scattering
atmosphere in the plane of the sky (e.g., Hoflich 1991, A & A, 246, 481);
however, this alone would produce a near-constant polarization level across
the spectrum, in contrast to the wavelength-dependent signal we observe
at our first 2 epochs.  Other mechanisms, such as occultation by clumps
in the outer ejecta or scattering by circumstellar dust (""light echoes,""
e.g., Nagao et al. 2018, arXiv:1805.11865) or other material in the vicinity,

We obtained 3 orbits of Hubble Space Telescope observations of the Type
I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) SN2018bsz, the lowest-redshift SLSN-I
at z=0.027 (ATels #11659, #11660, #11674; Hiramatsu et al. 2018), on 25
June 2018 UT.  The observations consist of 2 orbits of spectroscopy with
COS/FUV + G140L and 1 orbit with STIS/NUV-MAMA + G230L (PID: 15488; PI:
Blanchard). The resulting UV spectrum covers a rest-frame wavelength range
of ~1100 - 3100 angstroms and was obtained at a rest-frame phase of approximately
1 month after peak brightness.   

After correcting for Galactic extinction (E(B-V) = 0.207; Schlafly & Finkbeiner
2011) and comparing the spectrum with the near-peak UV spectra of the SLSNe-I
Gaia16apd (Yan et al. 2017), SN2017egm (Yan et al. 2018), and iPTF13ajg
(Vreeswijk et al. 2014), we find that SN2018bsz is overall similar in spectral
shape and shows most of the same strong UV features, namely broad absorptions
centered near 2650, 2200, 1750, and 1425 angstroms.  However, SN2018bsz
does not show obvious distinct absorption features near 2450 and 1950 angstroms
(the UV2 and UV4 features in the terminology of Quimby et al. 2018).  The
UV2 feature has been attributed to Si III or a blend of Si III + Ti III
+ C II (Quimby et al. 2011; Mazzali et al. 2016) and the UV4 feature has
been attributed to Fe III (Howell et al. 2013; Mazzali et al. 2016).  In
the spectra of Gaia16apd  and other SLSNe-I, the UV2 feature appears to
weaken with time (Yan et al. 2017; Quimby et al. 2018), and so its absence
in SN2018bsz may be attributable to the later phase of the observations.
In addition, the features that are present in SN2018bsz appear to be somewhat
broader than the other SLSNe-I with UV spectra, which may be causing increased
line blending.  

The far-UV spectrum from COS shows a similar overall shape to Gaia16apd
and SN2017egm, but line features appear relatively weak, which may again
be due to increased line blending or the later phase of observations. 

Finally, we note that the spectral differences between SN2018bsz and the
comparison objects may in part be related to having an unusual abundance
pattern, as evidenced by the optical spectra (ATel #11674).           

We thank STScI for making these observations possible.

We observed the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1566 with the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory

on  2018-06-24 from 17:12 to 17:27 and from 18:48 to 19:01 UT for a total
exposure time of 1.3 ks. 
This target of opportunity observation was triggered by an enhanced flux
level with respect to the  
secular flux average, as already reported using INTEGRAL data in ATeL #11754.

The Swift/XRT observation was carried out  
in photon counting mode to determine the source position which 
resulted to be  
RA=65.00165, Dec=-54.93793 (04h 20m 00.4s, -54&deg; 56&prime; 16.6&prime;&prime;)
with an uncertainty  
radius of 2.2&prime;&prime; (90% confidence level), using the enhanced
UVOT field astrometry. 
The X-ray spectrum is well described by an absorbed power law with photon
index &Gamma;=1.79&plusmn;0.14, N<sub>H</sub> < 3.1 &times;10<sup>20</sup>cm<sup>-2</sup>,
and 0.3-10 keV flux of  9.3&plusmn;0.7&times;10<sup>-11</sup> erg cm<sup>-2</sup>
s<sup>-1</sup> (L<sub>X</sub>=1.11&plusmn;0.08 &times;10<sup>42</sup> erg/s).

No significant variability has been detected on a 50-1000 s time scale.

The joint fit of the Swift/XRT and INTEGRAL/IBIS data yields &Gamma;=1.80<sup>+0.10</sup><sub>-0.6</sub>

and N<sub>H</sub> < 2 &times;10<sup>20</sup>cm<sup>-2</sup>. 

The source location is coincident with the known active nucleus of NGC
1566 and  
excludes the ultra luminous X-ray sources detected by Rosat (<a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/427170"">Liu
et al., ApJS, 157, 1, 2005</a>). 
The spectral shape is typical of Seyfert galaxies and marginally harder
and less absorbed than  
in archival Suzaku and Swift/BAT observations,  
when the source was about 15 times weaker (<a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/770/2/157/meta"">Kawamuro
et al., 2013, ApJ 770,2</a>).  
We conclude that  
the luminosity enhancement is most probably due to increased 
nuclear activity.

performing this target of opportunity observation. We acknowledge

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events arriving
from the position of AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn (Smartt et al., ATel #11727)
in the time range of the last confirmed non-detection (Fremling et al.
ATel #11738, 2018-06-13 00:00 UTC) to the detection time (ATel #11727,
2018-06-16 10:35 UTC).  Two neutrino track events are found in spatial
coincidence with AT2018cow during this ~3.5 day period and are consistent
with the expected rate of atmospheric neutrino background (0.17 events
expected in this time). A maximum likelihood analysis returns a p-value
of 0.03 (1.8 sigma).    Based on this, a time-integrated muon-neutrino
flux normalization upper limit assuming an E^-2 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE)  at
the 90% CL  of 6.1 x 10^-5 TeV cm^-2 is found for this observation period.

The detected neutrinos, both consistent with the source location within
the track uncertainties for these events (~2 degrees)  arrived at: 

2018-06-14 19:51:09 UTC (MJD 58283.827)

2018-06-15 10:25:50 UTC (MJD 58284.435)

While these detected neutrinos do not represent a significant detection,
their arrival times are of potential interest to the astronomical community.

We have continued to monitor the evolution of the optical transient AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn
(Smartt et al., ATEL#11727).  Low-resolution spectra have been taken each
night, using both SPRAT on the Liverpool Telescope (wavelength coverage
from 400-800 nm; resolution of 2 nm) and the SED Machine on the Palomar
60-inch telescope (wavelength coverage from 380-920 nm; resolution of 5
nm).  We are also monitoring the transient in ugrizH filters nightly at
LT. 

AT2018cow has faded every night since our first observations (ATEL#11732).
The spectrum and broadband optical colors have become slowly redder. 
Beginning on 2018-06-19 UT a broad spectral feature (with a peak of around
550 nm, or alternatively a dip around 450 nm) emerges, as noted by several
other groups (ATEL#11740, #11753, #11759, #11766).  Although this feature
broadly resembles the dominant spectral feature in optical spectra of Ic-BL
SNe, its identity is not definitive.  A possible spectral bump may be present
close to 850 nm in all subsequent SEDM spectra, although this is outside
the coverage of the LT spectrum and we have not confirmed its reality.

This 450/550 nm feature is strongest on 2018-06-21 UT, about five days
after the ATLAS discovery.  However, from then on it appears to weaken.
In our latest spectra, acquired with LT at 21:22 on 2018-06-24, it has
almost disappeared.  Photometrically, the SN has faded below the luminosity
of SN1998bw at a comparable epoch in all visible bands, although it remains
more luminous in the u-band.  The u-band is not within our nightly spectroscopic
coverage, but the u-g color excess suggests that there may be a separate
feature in the u-band that is persisting. 

These observations suggest that although a link to Ic-BL SNe and GRBs remains
credible given the smooth spectra and luminous radio and X-ray counterpart
(ATEL#11737, #11749, #11773, #11774, #11775), AT2018cow is distinct in
other ways and its true identity remains unclear.  Observations are continuing.

H-alpha and likely H-beta. Cross-correlation of the supernova spectrum

of a supernova candidate in the galaxy NGC 3256 on 2018 March 24.2 UT,
and confirmation imaging on 2018 April 7.2 UT. All observations were performed
on the ESO New Technology Telescope at La Silla using EFOSC2. The transient
was detected in images obtained during the follow-up of SN 2018ec (Kankare
et al. 2018, ATel #11156; Berton et al. 2018, ATel #11160) via comparison
with images obtained with EFOSC2 on 2018 January 17.2 UT. AT 2018cux is
located at RA = 10:27:51.41 and Dec = -43:54:18.00 (J2000.0), which is
1.8"" east and 4.0"" south of the i-band nucleus of the host galaxy. Subtraction
with the reference images yielded on 2018 March 24.2, m_g = 22.1 +/- 0.4,
m_r = 20.9 +/- 0.2, m_i = 20.6 +/- 0.1, and m_z = 20.1 +/- 0.1 mag; and
on 2018 April 7.2, m_g = 22.2 +/- 0.2, m_r = 20.8 +/- 0.3, m_i = 20.3 +/-
0.2, and m_z = 19.8 +/- 0.4 mag. Our most constraining non-detections are
from NTT/EFOSC2 on 2018 March 9.3 UT, m_r > 21.8 mag; and on 2018 March
10.2 UT, m_z > 20.9 mag. The host is a luminous infrared galaxy at a Tully-Fisher
distance of 37.4 Mpc (Tully 1988), with a high star formation rate and
an estimated core-collapse supernova rate of ~1 SN/yr. Based on the optical
colours, assuming a core-collapse supernova origin, the transient is likely
obscured by a few magnitudes of extinction in optical bands.

We report the search results of AT2018cow in the Swift/BAT data. 
Using the source location of (RA, Dec) = (244.00090, 22.26800) deg 
from Smartt et al. ATel #11727, the BAT mask-weighted light curve 
from the BAT survey data (14-195 keV) shows marginal detections  
of AT2018cow at ~ 3 sigma at ~T0, ~T0+1, and ~T0+6 days.  
T0 = 2018-06-16 at 10:35:02 UTC, which is the time of discovery 
reported in Smartt et al. ATel #11727.  

The 3 sigma detections are roughly consistent with NuSTAR flux  
measurements (Margutti et al., ATel #11775). However, we note that  
due to the low significance of these detections, we cannot rule out that

these are due to noise fluctuation. 

A search with the BAT onboard sub-threshold triggers found no events 
with localizations that are consistent with AT2018cow. 

The results of the BAT data analysis are at

a 5 GHz bandwidth. We observed for 8.8 hours and clearly detect an unresolved

ATEL #11775,"
NuSTAR started observing the transient AT2018cow (ATel #11727) on June
23  17:31:09 UT under Director Discretionary Time (DDT, PI Margutti). From
the analysis of 28 ks of data, we find the following preliminary results:

AT2018cow is very well detected with signal in excess of the background
up to 60 keV. NuSTAR data in the 3-60 keV range can be fit with a simple
power-law spectral model with best fitting photon index Gamma=1.20 +\-
0.03 (1 sigma c.l.). This is significantly harder than inferred from Swift-XRT
observations (Gamma~1.6; 0.3-10 keV) obtained around the same time.   

From our analysis of Swift-XRT observations of AT2018cow obtained so far
(Swift ID 10724, segments 2-14), we find no evidence for statistically
significant spectral evolution of the source. The combined 0.3-10 keV spectrum
is well described by a simple power-law with Gamma=1.62 +\- 0.03  (1 sigma
c.l.) and no evidence for intrinsic neutral hydrogen absorption in excess
to the Galactic component along the line of sight (NH_gal=4.95E+20 cm-2;
Kalberla et al., 2005). The temporal evolution of the 0.3-10 keV flux is
consistent with a ~t^-1 decay, assuming t0 to be near the initial optical
detection (ATel #11727). These results are in broad agreement with results
from previous Swift-XRT analysis ( ATels #11739  and 11761). We do not
confirm the soft photon index (Gamma~2.2; 0.5-10.0 keV)  and intrinsic
absorption NH~1d21 cm-2 inferred from NICER data (ATel #11773).  

Fitting the NuSTAR data with a broken power-law model we find a low-energy
photon index Gamma1=1.53 +\-  0.03  (1 sigma c.l.), with break energy E~15
keV, consistent with the results from the Swift-XRT data at 0.3-10 keV.
Above 15 keV NuSTAR data  show evidence for an additional hard X-ray component
with index Gamma2=0.50 +\- 0.05  (1 sigma c.l.).  The inferred flux of
the hard X-ray component between 15-79 keV is ~3e-11 ergs/cm^2/s.   Further
investigation is needed to constrain the physical origin of this hard X-ray
component.  

We thank the entire NuSTAR team for arranging these observations.

NICER observed the new transient AT2018cow = ATLAS18qqn (ATEL #11727, Smartt
et al. 2018) on 2018 June 22 at 21:02 UT, for a total of 950s.

After normalizing the spectrum against residuals found in direct fits to
the Crab nebula (see Ludlam et al. 2018), and using a standard background
region, the spectrum was grouped according to the ""optimal"" binning scheme
of Kaastra & Bleeker (2016), and fits were made over the 0.5-10.0 keV band.
A simple absorbed power-law model (ztbabs*zpow, assuming z=0.014) provides
an acceptable fit to the time-averaged spectrum:

N_H = 1.4(2) E+21 cm^-2,

Gamma = 2.2(1),

Norm = 2.5(2) E-3,

chi^2 / dof = 94.5/93,

Flux = 8.4 E-12 erg/cm^2/s (0.5-10.0 keV).

The short light curve from the observation shows weak variability but no
clear flux trend.  No significant coherent pulsations were found in an
acceleration search, after accounting for the number of trials in the search.

Additional NICER observations are being executed.

NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space
Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities

In response to the <a href=""http://maxi.riken.jp/alert/novae/8277849999/8277849999.htm"">MAXI
transient alert</a> regarding a new outburst of 4U 1630-47, NICER observed
the black hole candidate for 1.96 ks in three exposures, with the first
starting at 2018-06-11T13:37:26 (UTC). The source is clearly detected at
approximately 230 cts/s (0.2-12 keV); no features (broadband noise or quasi-periodic
oscillations) are present in the average power spectrum for this NICER
observation. An analysis of MAXI/Swift data (ATel #11722) has indicated
that this outburst is quite soft; no evidence of an initial hard state
is immediately apparent (consistent with the discussion of occasionally
missing hard states by Capitanio et al. 2015). 4U 1630-47 had reached a
0.5-10 keV flux of ~1e-8 erg/s/cm^2 (roughly 0.22 Crab) as of 15 June 2018.

The 0.25-12 keV NICER continuum, background-subtracted using the method
of Neilsen et al. (2018), is well described by an absorbed disk blackbody
(tbnew*ezdiskbb; Wilms et al. 2000; Zimmerman et al. 2005). The interstellar
absorption has a column density NH=(11.72+/-0.07)e22 with an enhanced Si
abundance (A_Si=2.3+/-0.1), though calibration uncertainties near the Si
edge make it difficult to interpret this result robustly. The disk has
a maximum temperature of (1.084+/-0.006) keV, which is similar to the result
reported from the Swift XRT several days later. Together with the variability
properties, this suggests that the source is in the soft state. 

In addition to the absorbed disk, we find evidence of several narrow emission
and absorption lines. The absorption features are consistent with Fe XXV
and Fe XXVI absorption in an outflowing wind, as has been seen on many
occasions in 4U 1630-47 and other, similar sources. These lines are detected
at 6.74 [-0.03,+0.05] keV and 7.00 [-0.02,+0.01] keV with equivalent widths
of 18 and 39 eV, respectively, and have 1-sigma widths below 0.023 keV
(roughly 900 km/s). The apparent blueshift of the gas is approximately
1600-1700 km/s and is statistically non-zero at the ~3 sigma level. The
precise numbers should be treated with caution in light of possible residual
gain calibration uncertainty near 6-7 keV that can reach 20-30 eV, but
previous observations of 4U 1630-47 with Suzaku and Chandra have revealed
similarly strong absorption lines with blueshifts ranging from 200-1500
km/s (Kubota et al. 2007; Neilsen et al. 2014; Miller et al. 2015). 

The emission lines are observed at (2.36+/-0.03) keV and (6.36-0.03+0.04)
keV, with ~4 sigma and ~3 sigma significance; we identify them as S K and
Fe K, respectively, though we cannot rule out an association between the
2.36 keV line and the gold edge from the NICER optics at this time. The
lines are nominally broader than the narrow absorption though still unresolved
at (0.05+/-0.03) keV. Fe K lines are commonly found in X-ray binaries,
but fluorescent lines from other elements are more rare. The S K detection
here is facilitated by NICER's large soft X-ray area. 

NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space
Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities
are funded by NASA.

ATEL #11758,"
We observed the field of ATLAS18qqn/AT2018cow (Smartt et al. ATel #11727)
consecutively in Bessel filters BVRI with the 1-m telescope at the Weihai
observatory. Observations started on 2018-06-20 12:23 UT for approximately
5 hours. We measured preliminary Vega magnitudes (not corrected for host
galaxy background contamination) as follows: 

B = 14.57 +/- 0.05 mag (start), k= 0.32 mag/day ; 
V = 14.30 +/- 0.02 mag (start), k= 0.28 mag/day ; 
R = 14.35 +/- 0.02 mag (start), k= 0.14 mag/day ; 
I = 14.57 +/- 0.03 mag (start), k=-0.19 mag/day ; 

where k is the decaying slope  from linear fit. The fading is consistent
with our previous observations (Zheng et al., ATel #11743) and other photometric
reports : Ahumada et al. (ATel #11752), Im et al. (ATel #11750), Watson

ATEL #11759,"
We report follow-up spectroscopic observations of AT2018cow (Smartt et
al. ATel #11727) with the 2-metre HCT.  
A spectrum spanning 3700-9100A was obtained on 2018 June 21.62 UT. A blackbody
fit to the spectrum indicates a temperature of ~10500K, cooling down from
~11200K deduced for the spectrum obtained on June 20.85 UT (ATel #11748).
The 4000-5500A region shows evidence of emergence of broad underlying features,
as observed by Izzo et al. (ATel #11753). We deduce a velocity of ~25,000
km/sec, assuming the feature at ~4800A corresponds to FeII 5169A (ATel
#11753).

with the SDSS g, r, i and z filters with the robotic IRiS 50-cm telescope
at Observatoire de Haute-Provence, France. Observations started on 2018-06-21
20h22 UT during approximately 2 hours, and the weather was partly cloudy
at the end of the observations. Observations were taken as follow: 5 min

We measured AB magnitudes (calibrated with the SDSS R9, but not corrected
for host galaxy background contamination) as follows: 

r_AB = 14.54 +- 0.18 
i_AB = 14.37 +- 0.20

We report on Swift X-ray observations of the optical transient AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn
(ATel #11727) obtained on 21 June 2018. We fitted an absorbed power law
model to the X-ray spectrum using wilm abundances (Wilms et al. 2000) and
vern cross-sections (Verner et al. 1996). We obtained the following values
nh= 1.0 +/- 0.9 e21 cm2, photon index  = 1.8 +/- 0.3 and flux= 1.2 +/-
0.2 e-11 erg/s/cm2 in the 0.3-10 keV band. Errors are at 90% confidence
interval. There is a small decrease in the X-ray flux compared to the value
obtained on 19 June 2018 (ATel #11739) when the source had a flux of 2.6
+/- 0.3 e-11 erg/cm2/s in the same energy band.  

We thank the Swift team for performing these ToO observations.

al. 2014</a>), using data from the quadruple 14-cm ""Brutus"" telescope 
in Haleakala, Hawaii, we discovered a new transient source, most 
likely a supernova, in the galaxy ABELL 0194. 

ASASSN-18nt (AT 2018ctv) was discovered in images obtained on UT 
2018-06-21.19 at V~17.2 mag. We do not detect (V>17.8) the object in 
images taken on UT 2018-06-17.59 and before. An image obtained on 
2018-06-22 using one of Las Cumbres Observatory 0.4-m robotic 
telescopes confirms the discovery of the transient. This <a

shows the archival SDSS g-band image of the host (left) and the LCO 
confirmation image (right). The red circle has a radius of 5"" and is 
centered on the position of the transient in the LCO image. 

The position of ASASSN-18nt is approximately 144"" North and 
168"" East from the center of the galaxy ABELL 0194 (z=0.018000, 
d=70.7 Mpc, via NED), giving an absolute V-band magnitude of 
approximately -17.2 (m-M=34.25, A_V=0.153). Properties of the new 
source and photometry are summarized in the tables below:

Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) to identify the type, phase, and redshift

of the SN spectra. The spectra matches with SN 1991bg-like SNe Ia near

peak. The redshifts derived from the best-fit templates are consistent

with that of Abell 0194. The luminosity derived from ASAS-SN discovery

magnitude is ~ -17.4 (assuming Galactic A_g = 0.15), consistent with a

ATEL #11765,"
We obtained a spectrum of classical nova candidate AT2018cmi (see <a href=""https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018cmi"">TNS</a>)
with the SPRAT spectrograph (resolution R~350; <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9147E..8HP"">Piascik
et al. 2014</a>) on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5489..679S"">Steele
et al. 2004</a>) on 2018 June 20.13 UT. A spectrum of AT2018bto/PNV J00434212+4122349/Gaia18bkp
(see <a href=""https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018bto"">TNS</a> and
ATel #11656) was taken on 2018 June 21.19 UT. 

The spectrum of AT2018cmi shows strong Balmer emission (H&alpha;, H&beta;,
H&gamma;, H&delta;) on top of a blue continuum. The Balmer lines exhibit
a 'boxy' profile with multiple peaks. The width of the H&alpha; and H&beta;
lines are around 4800 km/s. We also note tentative detections of N II 5001,
5679 and 5938 &#8491;, and He I 5876 &#8491; emission lines. There is no
strong evidence for the presence of any Fe II or O I lines. 

In conclusion, this spectrum confirms AT2018cmi is a classical nova in
M31, the line profiles, line velocities, and lack of Fe II/O I lines suggests
that this nova will belong to the He/N taxonomic class.  

This spectrum of AT2018bto also shows strong Balmer emission (H&alpha;,
H&beta;, H&gamma;, H&delta;) on top of a blue continuum. The FWHM of these
lines was measured to be about 2100 km/s. We tentatively detect emission
lines from [O III] 4363, 4959, 5007 &#8491;, along with the Bowen blend
at ~4640 &#8491;, with possible He II emission at 4686 &#8491;, and [O
I] at 6300 &#8491;. 

Therefore, we conclude the AT2018bto is a classical nova eruption in M31
and that the spectral evolution may have proceeded to the nebular phase.

Follow-up observations of both these novae are encouraged.

ATEL #11766,"
As part of our monitoring campaign with the HCT, we report further follow-up
spectroscopy of AT2018cow (Smartt et al. ATel #11727).  
A spectrum was obtained today on June 22.72 UT, covering the wavelength
range of 3700-9100A. The broad features in the 4000-5500A region show a
slight evolution compared to the HCT spectrum obtained yesterday at June
21.62 UT (Singh et al. ATel #11759). A blackbody model fit to the spectrum
yields a temperature of ~10500K, similar to the June 21 spectrum. Further
photometric and spectroscopic observations are planned with the HCT. 

We gratefully acknowledge the observing and support staff at IAO, Hanle
and CREST, Hoskote for making the observations possible.

ATEL #11767,"
I report on continuing observations of  AT2018cow (Smartt et al. 2017,
ATEL#11727) with the Ultra-Violet Optical Telescope (UVOT; Roming et al.
2005) on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Gehrels et al. 2004).  In
the most recent observation, beginning 2018-06-22 16:36:43 I measure the
following magnitudes in the UVOT/Vega-based photometric system using the
pipeline for the Swift Optical Ultraviolet Supernova Archive (SOUSA; Brown
et al. 2014): 

uvw2=12.87 +\- 0.03  

uvm2=12.83 +\- 0.04 

uvw1=12.97 +\- 0.03 

u=13.68 +\- 0.03 

b=15.14 +\- 0.04 

v=15.05 +\- 0.05 

These Vega magnitudes have not been corrected for reddening or the minimal
contribution from the host galaxy. 

The source remains very blue in UV-optical colors.  Compared to the earlier
observations (e.g. Rivera Sandoval & Maccarone, ATEL#11737) the transient
fades rather achromatically by about 0.3 mag/day.  Accounting for a MW
reddening of E(B-V)= 0.077 in the direction of the host (Schlafly & Finkbeiner
2011), the UVOT photometry spanning 1600-6000 Angstroms can be fit with
a blackbody with a temperature of about 25,000 K or a power law with an
index of alpha of approximately 3.

Further Swift observations are planned to monitor the X-ray and UV/optical
behavior of this source.

using the HFOSC instrument on 2018-06-20.85 UT (MJD 58289.7). We confirm
Ca H & K features (Jones et al. ATel #11736) at z = 0.014, the redshift
of the putative host galaxy CGCG 137-068. We also detect Galactic NaI doublet
at the rest wavelength, along with H-alpha emission feature at the rest
wavelength of the host galaxy (consistent with Perley ATel #11732). We
do not detect strong H-beta, however (Selsing et al. ATel #11741). In addition,
we see a Galactic DIB feature at 5797A, along with a tentative Galactic
DIB at 6283A. The spectrum also indicates a weak, broad absorption feature
at ~5040A (consistent with Xu et al. ATel #11740), with a Gaussian FWHM
of ~26A. We will continue to monitor this source with the HCT.

At 2018-06-20 UT, we observed the transient, AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn (Smartt
et al. ATel #11727) using various telescopes including the SNU Astronomical
Observatory (SAO) 1m telescope, the LOAO 1m telescope, the McDonald 0.8
m telescope, and the Lee Sang Gak Telescope (LSGT) at SSO. A series of
BVRI and griz data were obtained.  
From the SAO 1m telescope image taken at 2018-06-20 12:34:26 UT, we find
the following magnitudes (host light is not subtracted) for the object.
The magnitudes are in Vega system, and calibrated against APASS stars in
the vicinity. 

V = 14.21 +- 0.02, 
R = 14.29 +- 0.03. 

The observation of this object is continuing. We thank the operators of
the LOAO 1m telescope, Jae-Hyuk Yoon and In-Kyung Baek for their assistance
with the observation.

We monitored the field of AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn (Smartt et al. ATel #11727)
with the COATLI 50-cm telescope and interim imager at the Observatorio
Astron&oacute;mico Nacional on the Sierra de San Pedro M&aacute;rtir (<a
href=""http://coatli.astroscu.unam.mx"">http://coatli.astroscu.unam.mx</a>)
in BVRI from 2018-06-21 04:04 to 10:01.

We detect the transient at r = 14.9 mag. This magnitude is calibrated against
the Pan-STARRS1 catalog and is not corrected for Galactic extinction in
the direction of the source.

We also detect fading in all filters by about 0.1 magnitudes over 6 hours.

Further observations are planned.

We thank the COATLI technical team (Fernando &Aacute;ngeles, Oscar Chapa,
Salvador Cuevas, Alejandro Farah, Jorge Fuentes, Rosal&iacute;a Langarica,
Fernando Quir&oacute;s, and Carlos Tejada) and the staff of the Observatorio
Astron&oacute;mico Nacional.

ATEL #11752,"
We obtained photometry of AT2018cow (ATLAS18qqn; Smartt et al. ATel #11727)
using the KPED camera on the Kitt Peak 84 inch telescope. Photometry began
at June 20 04:19 UT on 2018-06-20. KPED is an EMCCD sensor, with the ability
to run as a normal CCD, and photometry was run in both modes. The first
was performed in the normal CCD mode, and we derive the following magnitudes
(all in the AB system) using aperture photometry and field stars to set
the zeropoint: 

U =  13.9+/- 0.3 mag 
g' = 14.4 +/- 0.2 mag, 
r' = 14.2 +/- 0.1 mag,  
I = 14.5 +/- 0.2 mag, 

Our photometry has not been corrected for host galaxy background contamination
or Galactic extinction. The magnitudes are consistent with the blue, power-law
reported by others (ATel #11732) and show fading of r=0.1 mags and g=0.7
mags compared to GROND measurements from 2018-06-19 (ATel #11734).  

A second set of photometry was obtained in g-band in the EMCCD mode at
a cadence of 1 Hz. Observations began at June 20 04:58 UT on 2018-06-20
and lasted approximately 4.5 hrs. The g-band observations show a predominantly
monotonically decreasing brightness, fading approximately 0.1 mag over
4.5 hrs, consistent with the fading reported by GROND (ATel #11734).  

We attach a link to a finding chart based on KPED observations below. Further
observations with KPED are planned.

ATEL #11754,"
During the observations of the Reticulum II region carried out 
from 2018 June 12 to 2018 June 19 (total exposure time of 208 ks), 
the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on board INTEGRAL detected significant hard 
X-ray emission from a source with coordinates: 

RA:  4:19:49 Dec: -54:56:28, with 3.5 arcmin 90% confinement radius and

spatially coincident with the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1566. 

The source was detected in the IBIS/ISGRI mosaic images 
at a significance level of 9.4 (5.5) sigma and a flux of 5.9 &plusmn; 
0.6 mCrab 
(6 &plusmn; 1 mCrab) in the 20-40 keV (40-80 keV) energy band. 
The source remains below the sensitivity level in any one of the 
individual 70 ks datasets if analysed separately. 
The source was not detected in the JEM-X mosaic images, 
from which we estimated a 5 sigma upper limit of 3 mCrab in the 3-10 keV

band. Assuming a distance of 10 Mpc (Gouliermis et al. 2017 MNRAS 468,
509), 
the flux measured in June 2018 
corresponds to a 20-80 keV X-ray luminosity of about 10<sup>42</sup> erg/s.

Hard X-ray radiation from NGC 1566 was also detected by INTEGRAL in a 
previous observation 
carried out from 2018 December 26 to 2018 January 27 (total exposure time

of 492 ks) at a lower flux: 
2.6 &plusmn; 0.3 mCrab (2.5 &plusmn; 0.7 mCrab) in the 20-40 keV (40-80

keV) energy band. No INTEGRAL observations of that region were performed
before. 

X-ray emission from NGC 1566 was reported on data from 
December 2004 to August 2013 
in the <a href=""https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/bs105mon/216"">Swift

BAT 105-month catalogue</a> 
at a lower flux level of ~2&times;10<sup>-11</sup> erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s
in the  
15-200 keV energy band (0.8 mCrab or 15-200 keV luminosity: 
2.3&times;10<sup>41</sup> erg/s). 
Swift/BAT detected a brightening from NGC 1566 with duration of about two
months 
and a peak flux of 4 mCrab only once from 2004 to 2013. 

The enhanced hard X-ray emission from NGC 1566 detected by INTEGRAL 
might be 
caused by a high luminosity state of the AGN at the center of NGC 1566

or by an extremely bright hard X-ray outburst produced by another source

belonging to the galaxy (for example, Liu & Bregmann 2005, ApJSS 157, 
59 report the 
presence of three ULXs in NGC 1566) or spatially coincident with it. 

Additional INTEGRAL observations of the region around the source are 
already planned for the coming weeks. A target of opportunity 
observation with the 
Niel Gehrels Swift observatory has been approved. 

Further observations of the source in soft X-rays, as well as in other

energy domains, are encouraged.

We report time-series photometry of X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 = ASASSN-18ey
with the globally distributed small telescopes of the Center for Backyard
Astrophysics (CBA; Patterson et al. 2013; MNRAS 434, 1902). Our photometry
covers 88 of the 98 days since discovery on 11 March 2018. The average
nightly time series was ~10 hours in duration, with various time resolutions
ranging from 3 to 40 s. Most observations were in V light, with some unfiltered
time series converted to V magnitudes by applying additive constants measured
by simultaneous unfiltered and V magnitudes. 

During the first 80 days of outburst, no persistent periodic signal was
found, to a limit of 0.04 mag amplitude. There was weak evidence for a
transient periodic signal with P~8 hours during several ~5-day segments
of dense coverage. Starting ~5 June 2018, the star began to brighten and
show obvious (0.4 mag full amplitude) waves with a period of 0.703 days.
The power spectrum and light curve are shown at <a href=https://cbastro.org/the-astronomers-telegram/2018-june/>https://cbastro.org/the-astronomers-telegram/2018-june/</a>.
Clued in to this period, we could discern this wave another ~5 days before
it became obvious. Over a 20-night baseline, the star obeyed the strict
ephemeris 

Minimum light = HJD 2,458,281.595(10) + 0.703(3) E. 

We also saw ~10 s QPOs early in the outburst, as did many other optical
and X-ray observers. The phase stability of the 0.703 d wave makes it a
good candidate for the orbital period of the underlying compact binary,
although other interpretations (superhump? precession?) are possible. Spectroscopic
observation could test this hypothesis, and ascertain the dominant light
source in the binary.

ATEL #11757,"
We observed the field of ATLAS18qqn/AT2018cow (Smartt et al. ATel #11727)
consecutively in L filter (Astronomik facturer) with RC telescope of 60
cm at Les Makes Observatory (La Reunion, France).  
Observations began at 2018-06-20 17:04 UT and ended at 2018-06-20 22:09
UT. 8 images were taken. We also observed the field of ATLAS18qqn/AT2018cow
with TAROT-La Reunion (TRE) and Tarot-Chile (TCH). Observations began at
2018-06-20 17:30 UT and ended at 2018-06-21 06:42 UT. 16 images were taken
with filters C, r, g, i. Calibrating the images taken in filters L, C and
r in the AB photometric system, we deduce a fading with a slope of 0.75
mag/day. 

The fading is consistent with our previous observations (Zheng et al.,
ATel #11743) and other photometric reports : Ahumada et al. (ATel #11752),
Im et al. (ATel #11750), Watson et al. (ATel #11751), Smart et al. (ATel
#11742, #11727), Fremling et al. (ATel #11738), Chen et al. (ATel #11734,

We greatly thank the AGORA association for making the observations.

ATEL #11753,"
We observed ATLAS18qqn/AT2018cow (ATels: #11727, #11729, #11732, #11734,
#11736, #11737, #11738, #11740, #11741, #11742, #11743, #11744, #11748,
#11749, #11750, #11751, #11752) with OSIRIS/GTC on June 21, 2018 starting
at 03:20 UT. Spectra were obtained with the R1000B and R2500I grisms with
an exposure time of 2x120s each in each grism, covering the wavelength
range between 3700 and 10000 AA.

The spectrum is dominated by a power-law continuum (probably due to the
tail of the very hot black body mentioned in ATel #11742) with superposed
undulations. By subtracting this continuum we find similarities with a
broad-line type Ic supernova spectrum (see also ATel #11740), although
a direct match is not obvious. The spectrum is dominated by a peak at 5460
AA, bluewards of which there is an absorption feature that could be interpreted
as FeII 5169 AA expanding at 20000 km/s.

We observed the transient ATLAS18qqn/AT2018cow (ATels: #11727, #11729,
#11732, #11734, #11736, #11737, #11738, #11740, #11741, #11742, #11743,
#11744, #11748) using NOEMA. The observation started on 20 June 2018 at
21:55 UT and was performed in the 90 and 150 GHz bands. The object is well
detected in both bands, and a preliminary reduction delivers a flux density
of ~6mJy at 90GHz. The coordinates of the source are (J2000):

R.A.: 16:16:00.254

Dec.: 22:16:05.10

This detection indicates that there is a strong non-thermal contribution
to the emission, which favours the interpretation of this transient as
a relativistic event.

The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) reports Palomar 48-inch
(P48) observations of the optical transient AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn (ATel
#11737, #11734, #11732, #11729, #11727). While reference images from the
P48 have not yet been generated for this field, we are able to produce
host-subtracted photometry using Pan-STARRS1 images. 

AT2018cow was not detected in the i-band on 2018-06-13.17206 (JD = 2458282.672),
to a depth of 19.5 mag. This provides a stricter constraint (by ~1 day)
on the rise-time compared to ATel #11727. Furthermore, on 2018-06-17.1953
(JD = 2458286.695) we derive an i-band magnitude of 14.32 +/- 0.01.

Using the ~0.9ks Swift observations (from 2018-06-19T10:34:53 to 2018-06-19T13:38:52)
of the optical transient AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn, we have fitted an absorbed
power law model using wilm abundances (Wilms et al. 2000) and VERN cross-sections
(Verner et al. 1996) to the X-ray spectrum and obtained the following values
nh = 5.2 +/- 4.7 E20 cm2, photon index 1.6 +/- 0.1 and flux 2.6 +/- 0.3
E-11 erg/cm2/s  in the 0.3-10 keV band. In Atel #11737, where we reported
on ~0.5 ks Swift observations, the reported error in nh should be 8.0 instead
of 0.08. Errors are at 90% confidence interval. 

We thank the Swift team for approving and executing our ToO.

ATEL #11741,"
We observed AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn (Smartt et al. ATEL #11727) with VLT X-shooter
on 20 June 2018, beginning at 02:18UT. A total of 600s of exposure time
was obtained with spectra spanning the range 3000-25000A.  

The source is well detected across the wavelength range with very high
signal to noise. We identify Ca H&K and Na ID absorption from the putative
host galaxy CGCG 137-068. This confirms other spectroscopy (Jones et al.
ATEL #11736) that AT2018cow is not Galactic and lies at (or beyond) z=0.0140.
We also identify a range of narrow emission lines from OII (3727), Hbeta,
OIII (4959,5007), H-alpha and NII that are likely from the host galaxy.

The source is very blue, and can be adequately, but not perfectly, described
by a power-law with beta=-3 (F_nu ~ nu^{-beta})  Alternatively a thermal
model with a temperature of ~18,000K can be used. Neither scenario provides
a good fit across the entire wavelength range. In particular, the presence
of a very broad feature in the 5000-6000A range is noted in both cases,
somewhat redder than reported by Xu et al. (ATEL #11740). There is also
some evidence from deviation away from power-law of thermal models around
3750A. 

We thank the staff of Paranal for their excellent assistance with these
observations.

"
ATEL #11742,"
We report further observations and basic analysis of 
ATLAS18qqn/AT2018cow with ATLAS, ASASSN and the Liverpool Telescope. 
Two spectra were taken with the LT + SPRAT on 2016-06-18 and and 
2016-06-19. Similar to Perley (ATel #11732) and Jones et al. 
(ATel #11736) we see a very blue, mostly featureless continuum. After 
correcting for foreground extinction (E(B-V)=0.08), the continuum is 
well matched to a thermal black-body of T=25000K. 

The latest ATLAS point (Smartt et al. ATel #11727) is cyan 
c=13.60+/- 0.02 on MJD=58287.45 (similar to Chen and Schady ATel #11734).

Making it rather luminous at M_c = -20.5 if it is in CGCG 137-068.  

Correcting the spectrum to the dereddened c-band magnitude and 
assuming the object's SED follows a thermal black body, provides 
an estimate of total luminosity at this epoch of L = 4.1e44 erg/s, 
at a distance of 60 Mpc. At Teff=25,000 K, this implies a radius of 
1.2e15cm (or 1.75e4 R_sol). 

There are recent non-detections by ATLAS (Smartt et al. ATel #11727) 
and ZTF (Fremling et al. ATel #11738) and ASASSN  on MJD=58284. This 
implies a rise time (to c=13.6) of t_rise < 3.3 days. This is remarkably
short for a 
supernova type transient to reach this luminosity. 

The rise time would imply an expansion velocity (to get to 1.2e15cm) of
v = 
42,000 km/s (or shock breakout from a very extended star). 

The detection of host galaxy absorption features of CGCG 137-068 
(Jones et al. ATel #11736, Selsing et al. Atel #11741) at z=0.014, the

Swift x-ray detection by Rivera Sandoval et al. ATel #11737, #11739), and

the GROND rapid decline (Chen and Schady ATel #11734) suggest either  
a very high velocity (mildy relativistic) explosion (v>0.14c) or shock

breakout from an extraordinary progenitor.

ATEL #11743,"
We observed the field of ATLAS18qqn/AT2018cow (Smartt et al. ATel #11727)
consecutively in Bessel filters BVRI (and in clear) with the KAIT telescope
at the Lick observatory. Observations began at 2018-06-20 04:25:38 UT and
ended at 2018-06-20 09:37:35.990 UT. 15 separate sets of observations were
performed. The first set of Vega magnitudes (not corrected for host galaxy
background contamination) are as follows: 

B = 14.38 +/ 0.06 mag, 

V = 14.20 +/ 0.03 mag, 

R = 14.25 +/ 0.03 mag, 

I = 14.41 +/ 0.03 mag, 

Over the 5 hrs of observations, the object faded 0.06, 0.09, 0.05, and
0.06 mags in B, V, R, I respectively. This fade is consistent with the
values reported by GROND (Chen and Schady, Atel #11734).

is no detection at the source location, and we measure a 3 sigma upper
limit of ~370uJy at 3GHz. The target location was also observed in the
VLA FIRST survey (Becker et al. 1994) on 1995-12-31, and 1997-01-31. For

(BTS; ATel #11688) reports classifications of the following targets. Spectra
have been obtained with the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM)
(range 350-950nm, spectral resolution R~100) mounted on the Palomar 60-inch
(P60) telescope (Blagorodnova et. al. 2018, PASP, 130, 5003). Classifications
were done with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). Redshifts
are derived from the broad SN features (two decimal points), and from narrow
SN features or host galaxy lines (three decimal points). Limits prior to
detection and current magnitudes are available on the Transient Name Server
(https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il).

ATEL #11747,"
Liller 1 is a Galactic globular cluster hosting the transient neutron star
low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) known as the Rapid Burster (MXB 1730-335).
Recent Swift and Chandra observations in late April 2018 identified a new
transient X-ray binary in this cluster (CXOU J173324.6-332321, hereafter
Liller 1 X-2, ATel #11598) and radio/X-ray follow up observations with
VLA and Swift indicated that this new transient is likely a neutron star
LMXB as well (ATel #11646).  

We have continued monitoring Liller 1 weekly with Swift/XRT. The outburst
from X-2 peaked at an XRT count rate of ~1 ct/s (in the 0.3-10 keV band)
on May 17th, 2018 (ObsID 31360148) and we observed the decay in the subsequent
observations until June 11th, 2018. We estimate a Swift/XRT count rate
of ~0.006 ct/s (0.3-10 keV) in observation on June 11th, 2018 (ObsID 31360155).
This rate appears to be consistent with the expected Swift/XRT rate from
Liller 1 when all of its sources are in quiescence.  

However, a short (200 s) Swift/XRT observation on June 18th, 2018 (ObsID
31360156) indicated a count rate of ~10 ct/s (0.3-10 keV) from the direction
of Liller 1. Since this observation was in PC mode, pile up and the short
exposure made it difficult to characterize the X-ray light curve and spectrum.
We thus requested a longer follow up  XRT observation that would be performed
in WT mode. In this follow up observation on June 19th, 2018 (ObsID 31360157)
we clearly detect two Type II X-ray bursts and thus identify the Rapid
Burster as the source currently in outburst in Liller 1. 

Outside of the two type II bursts, we see a typical XRT count rate of 10
cts/s, dipping slightly before the bursts. The first burst starts 250 s
into the observation, and increases within 3 seconds to ~200 ct/s. After
50 s, it declines quickly to ~80 ct/s, where it remains for ~25 s, then
declines within ~5 s to slightly below the pre-burst level, recovering
within 100 s. 600 s later, another burst starts in the same way, but the
observation cuts off <20 s after the burst begins. We tentatively identify
these bursts as mode 0 (using the scheme of Bagnoli et al. 2015, MNRAS,
449, 268). 

We thank the Swift team for approving and rapidly scheduling our observations.

ATEL #11740,"		Transient

We obtained 2x1200s spectroscopy of the bright transient AT2018cow (ATLAS18qqn;
Smartt et al. ATel #11727) using the BFOSC camera on the Xinglong-2.16m
telescope. Spectroscopy started at 13:25:11 UT on 2018-06-20, and the wavelength
range covers 3600-9000 AA. 

Due to relatively low spectral resolution, we cannot confirm the presence
of Ca II H&K absorption features at z=0 and at z=0.014 (likely the redshift
of the transient's host galaxy CGCG 137-068), which has been claimed in
Jones et al. (ATel #11736). 

As a whole, the Xinglong spectrum is blue and thermal-like. However, a
prominent feature is evident in the blue end, more likely a bump centered
on ~3960 AA than an absorption trough centered ~3790 AA, depending on the
fitting of the spectral continuum. If understood as an absorption feature,
it could be He I [3889]. A weak broad feature is also evident at ~5040
AA, implying very high velocity that can be seen inbroad-lined Type Ic
supernovae. All the wavelengths are in the observer frame. 

Further spectroscopic observations are planned.

V4332 Sgr is a luminous red nova exploded in 1994. We perform CCD BVRcIc
photometry of its remnant since 2003, and medium resolution spectroscopy
since 2005 using Russian 6 m telescope BTA, SAO 1 m Zeiss telescope and
smaller telescopes of SAI Crimean Station. Between 2006 and 2008, the observations
reveal the abrupt drop of flux by 4 times in the blue range, and reddening
of stellar continuum, whereas emission line fluxes decreased by 30 times.
Since 2012, the star brightness was grown up gradually. However, the rate
of brightening accelerated since the last year. The following Table gives
magnitudes taken with the BTA 6 m telescope and SCORPIO focal reducer,
and with SAO 1 m telescope and UBVRI photometer based on CCD EEV 42-40
chip during the last seven years.

Note, that magnitudes raised by 0.15 in the Rc band, and by 0.10 in the
Ic band during the last month. The contemporary level of brightness has
reached the 2002 level in the Rc filter, and has exceeded the 2002 level
in Ic filter. Besides, color indices stay essentially red comparatively
with the 2002 levels. The last spectrum has been taken with the BTA/SCORPIO
on 2017 Jul 21.92 UT. It was flux calibrated using the magnitudes obtained
from our photometry. The spectral range was 4048 -- 5842 &#197;, spectral
resolution was 5.3 &#197;. The fluxes of the strongest emission lines of
Ca I, Cr I, AlO look weaker only by 2-3 times comparatively with those
in 2005, but Mg I 4571 &#197; and Sr I 4607 &#197; emission disappeared.
Barsukova et al. (2017, ASPC, 510, 401) suggest that the 1994 event was
the merger in a contact system with a 3-rd companion, an M-type giant,
and the cool supergiant remnant of the merger was destroyed dynamically
under influence of the 3-rd companion. The recent re-brightening was explained
by authors as a result of the new approach of remnant debris moving on
an elliptical orbit with the M-type star, and the accretion of them onto
this star.

ATEL #11734,"
We observed the field of ATLAS18qqn/AT2018cow (Smartt et al. ATel #11727)

simultaneously in g'r'i'z'JHK with GROND (Greiner et al. 2008, PASP 120,
405) 
mounted at the MPG 2.2m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory (Chile).

<p/> 

Observations started at 04:50 UT on 2018-06-19 (MJD = 58288.202), 2.8 days
after 
the ATLAS discovery. We derive the following magnitudes (all in 
the AB system) using aperture photometry with a aperture of the mean FWHM
of the field stars: 

g' = 13.65 +/- 0.01 mag,<br />  
r' = 14.14 +/- 0.01 mag,<br />  
i' = 14.48 +/- 0.03 mag,<br />  
z' = 14.67 +/- 0.03 mag,<br />  
J = 15.05 +/- 0.01 mag,<br />  
H = 15.40 +/- 0.02 mag, and<br />  
K = 15.68 +/- 0.02 mag.<br /> 
Our photometry has not been corrected for host galaxy background contamination.
<br /> 

The above magnitudes are consistent with the blue, power-law spectral shape
reported by  
Perley (ATel #11732), and imply a hotter temperature than implied by our
first epoch of  
GROND observations (Chen & Rabus; ATel #11729), which was based on PSF
photometry.  
Using aperture photometry, we now derive the following AB magnitudes for
the observations  
taken on 2018-06-18: 

g' = 13.42 +/- 0.01 mag,<br />  
r' = 13.89 +/- 0.01 mag,<br />  
i' = 14.14 +/- 0.03 mag,<br />  
z' = 14.33 +/- 0.03 mag,<br />  
J = 14.72 +/- 0.01 mag,<br />  
H = 15.14 +/- 0.02 mag, and<br />  
K = 15.29 +/- 0.02 mag.<br /> 

Given magnitudes are calibrated against SDSS field stars as well as 2MASS
field 
stars and are not corrected for the expected Galactic foreground extinction

corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V) = 0.08 mag in the direction of
the 
transient (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011).  

This object is now fading in all bands, e.g. 0.25 mag/day in GROND r band
and  
0.34 mag/day in GROND J band from 2018-06-18 to 2018-06-19.    

We acknowledge excellent help in obtaining these data from Markus Rabus
on La Silla.

ATEL #11736,"
We obtained a spectrum of AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn (ATel #11727) with the Kast
spectrograph on the Shane telescope, on 2018 Jun 19 UT. The spectrum is
blue and featureless, in accordance with ATel #11732. We detect Ca II H&K
absorption features at z=0 and at z=0.014, providing evidence that the
transient is associated with CGCG 137-068. Further spectroscopic observations
are encouraged.

"
ATEL #11737,"
We report on 0.5 ks Swift observations of the optical transient AT2018cow/ATLAS18qqn
(ATel #11734, #11732, #11729, #11727). The observations were taken on 19
June 2018 using the XRT and UVOT instruments. Fitting an absorbed powerlaw
model to the X-ray spectrum at z=0 we obtained nH= 6.8  +/- 0.08 e20 cm2,
photon index = 1.48 +/- 0.2 and a flux of 3.4 +/- 0.5 e-11 ergs/cm2/s in
the 0.3-10 keV band. 

We determine UVOT magnitudes in the following 6 filters (all in Vega system)

v = 13.79 +/- 0.04 mags 

b = 13.82 +/- 0.02 mags 

u = 12.53 +/- 0.03  mags  

uvw1 = 11.75 +/- 0.02 mags 

uvw2 = 11.70 +/- 0.01 mags 

uvm2 = 11.60 +/- 0.02 mags  

If the object is a CV with typical M_V= 5, the object would be at a distance
of around 600pc. This means that the X-ray luminosity would be Lx ~1.4e33
erg/sec, suggesting that the WD would be heavy, both to allow such high
X-ray luminosity and to have the X-ray spectrum be so hard. However, the
fast evolution of the outburst suggests it is a short orbital period system.

If as suggested in Atel #11736, the source is associated with CGCG 137-068,
Lx would be about 10^10 times higher, or Lx ~1.4e43 erg/sec.  In this case,
the mostly featureless spectrum and this X-ray luminosity combine to suggest
a gamma-ray burst afterglow, perhaps from an off-axis GRB. 

"
ATEL #11728,"
We obtained an optical spectrum (range 350-890 nm) of PTSS-18fdb (AT 2018cni),
discovered by the PMO-Tsinghua Supernova Survey (PTSS, http://www.cneost.org/ptss/),
on UT 2018 June 17.7 with the Li-Jiang 2.4 m telescope (LJT+YFOSC) at Li-Jiang
Observatory of Yunnan Observatories. The spectrum shows that is a peculiar
type Ia supernova at about a few days before the maximum light. Cross-correlation
with a library of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification""
code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, Ap.J. 666, 1024) shows that it matches
with SN 2005hk at t = - 3 days. Given a redshift of 0.032 for the host
galaxy derived from SNID fitting, an expansion velocity of about 5500 km/s
can be deduced from the Si II 635.5 absorption minimum.

stars and are not corrected for the expected Galactic foreground extinction

corresponding to a reddening of E_(B-V) = 0.08 mag in the direction of
the 
transient (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011).  

After correcting for Milky Way extinction, we fitted SED assuming a black
body,  
which indicates a temperature of 9200 +/- 600 K.  
This object may have risen 0.5 mag/day roughly compared between GROND-r
and ATLAS-o bands.

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient. 

We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their
continued support of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation through grant GBMF5490 to the Ohio State University,

We report the following classifications of optical transients from spectroscopic
observations with the Goodman spectrograph on the Southern Astrophysical
Research (SOAR) telescope. Targets were supplied by the ATLAS and ASAS-SN.
All observations were made on 2018 Jun 18 UT. Classifications were performed
with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).

Notes: 
When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from the
SN spectrum.  Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy.

(1) We measure a Si II 6355 velocity of -15,600 km/s 
(2) The SN appears to be relatively young, consistent with the photometry.
The Balmer lines have Lorentzian profiles with FWHM ~ 1500 km/s.  There
is strong He II 4686 emission.

We obtained spectroscopy of the bright transient AT2018cow (ATLAS18qqn;
Smartt et al. ATel #11727) using SPRAT (Piascik et al. 2014)  on the 2-m
Liverpool Telescope.  The spectrum, taken at 2018-06-18.951 UT, is very
blue and hot, approximately described by a power-law in flux with F_lambda
~ lambda^(-3.2).  There are no strong emission or absorption features visible
across the observed wavelength range (between 402-800 nm, wavelength resolution
~2 nm).  In particular, we observe no features either at z=0 or at z=0.0141
(the redshift of the coincident galaxy CGCG 137-068), with the exception
of weak H-alpha at the galaxy redshift which could originate from the galaxy
background.

ASASSN-18mr (TNS #19408) is a g=17.7 mag transient in the host galaxy 2MASX
J23393156-0308565,  
at a distance of 96 Mpc (z=0.023763) discovered by the All Sky Automated
Survey for SuperNovae  
(ASAS-SN, Holoien, et al. 2017, MNRAS, 464, 2672) on 2018-06-14. 

It is spatially coincident (within 0.4 arcsec) with a Pan-STARRS 
transient discovered in 2015. The Pan-STARRS Survey for Transients 
(PSST) reported PS15dkt at w = 20.72 +/- 0.05 on 2015-12-09 
(MJD=57365.2).  It is also detected in poor seeing images the night 
after (For PSST information, see http://star.pst.qub.ac.uk/ps1threepi/

Photometry obtained on 2018-06-17.20 using LT+IO:O returns the following

magnitudes: g 17.62 (0.02), g-r = 0.41 (0.03), suggesting that the object
is still  
rising to the maximum light. 

A spectrum taken on 2018-06-17.192 (UT) using SPRAT on the Liverpool Telescope

(range 400-810 nm, resol. 1.8 nm) shows the characteristic interaction
driven hydrogen  
emission lines of a type IIn SN. 

The spectrum is dominated by relatively narrow H lines in emission, with
a FWHM velocity of 2000 km/s.  
A weak Na ID feature (possibly blended with He I 5876) and a broad bump
at 5200-5300 A, possibly 
due to a blend of Fe II lines, are also detected. The spectrum is somewhat
similar to that of the type IIn  SN 2009ip (e.g. Pastorello et al. 2013,
ApJ, 767,1; Fraser et al. 2013, MNRAS, 433, 1312). 
Type IIn spectral features are in general interpreted as signature of 
interaction between the SN ejecta 
and circumstellar material. As a faint transient was observed 2.5 years
before the explosion of ASASSN-18mr  
at the same location, this was likely a preSN major outburst, similar to
those observed before the 
explosion of several Type IIn SNe.

ATLAS is a twin 0.5m telescope system on 
Haleakala and Mauna Loa. Each unit has a single camera covering 
28.9 square degree field of view and is  
robotically surveying the sky every night. 
Two filters are used, cyan and orange  
(denoted c and o, all mags in AB system), more information is on  
http://www.fallingstar.com. While carrying out the primary mission for
NEOs, 
we search for and publicly report stationary transients (see 
Tonry et al. ATel #8680, Tonry et al. 2018, PASP, 130, 4505).  

We report a bright new transient source, which is spatially coincident

with the galaxy CGCG 137-068 (z=0.014145, 60 Mpc).  
We discovered ATLAS18qqn (AT2018cow)   
on 
MJD 58285.441 == 2018-06-16 10:35:02 UTC 
at 
o = 14.76 +/- 0.10.  
ATLAS18qqn  
is offset by 
3.46 arsec south, 
4.86 arcsec west of the core of  
CGCG 137-068. 
If it were in the galaxy it would be M_o = -19.2.  

It has a very fast rise time, with no detection on MJD=58281.5 to 
o~19.5.  Most likely it is a foreground CV in chance alignment with 
the galaxy. There are a number of blue knots (possible foreground 
stars or host galaxy features) visible in the Pan-STARRS and SDSS 
images. The transient is close to but not coincident with any of 
these sources.  
There are no previous outbursts in ATLAS or any other survey that we 
are aware of.  

To rule this out being a very unusual transient in this galaxy  
CGCG 137-068, or (more likely) confirm it as a foreground CV, 
a spectrum is required.

We observed the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 (ASASSN-18ey, see ATels

#11576, #11578, #11591, #11596, #11609) with the fiber-fed fast optical
photon counter IFI+IQUEYE, mounted at the 1.2 m Galileo telescope in Asiago.
The source was observed in white light on April 18-19 and May 21-22. 

On April 18 and 19, seven 900s observations were carried out between MJD
58226.991338 (Apr 18 23:47:31.6 UT) and MJD 58227.144271 (Apr 19 03:27:45.0
UT). On May 21 and 22, eight observations of different duration (between
300s and 900s each) were performed between MJD 58259.974418 (May 21 23:23:09.7
UT) and MJD 58260.173968 (May 22 01:46:30.8 UT). We retained only the observations
with better sky conditions, for a total useful on-source time of 3600s
(4 observations) in April 18-19 and 1200s (3 observations) in May 21-22.
The fractional root-mean-square (rms) variability of the 1s binned light
curve was 8.1% on April 18-19, when the background-subtracted average source
rate was ~8700 counts/s (background rate ~2200 c/s). The sky background
was regularly monitored with acquisitions performed between on-target observations.
Also a nearby field star with comparable count rate was pointed in between
on-target observations and showed a significantly lower rms (3.7%). On
May 21-22, the source net rate and fractional rms were ~900 c/s and 5.1%.

Power spectra of the non-background subtracted light curves with a time
bin of 1 ms were computed for each night and were then averaged over intervals
of 130s duration. In the observations taken on April 18-19 we detect a
significant quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) on the top of three broad-band
noise components. The QPO has a centroid frequency of 128 +/- 2 mHz, a
full-width-half-maximum of 24 +/- 5 mHz, and a fractional root-mean-square
variability of 3.1 +/- 0.3 %. Another QPO-like feature at lower frequency
and with lower significance is present in the power spectrum with centroid
frequency 71 +/- 4 mHz, full-width-half-maximum 36 +/- 16 mHz, and fractional
root-mean-square variability 3.2 +/- 0.6 %. 

The 128 mHz QPO has a width consistent with that of the optical QPO reported
in ATel #11591. The frequency difference between the two measurements,
that are approximately 3.7 days apart, is 29 mHz. The fractional increment
of the centroid frequency of the optical QPO is consistent with that calculated
for a similar QPO detected in the X-rays with NuSTAR and reported in ATel
#11578. The properties (frequency and width) of the 128 mHz optical QPO
are also consistent with those of the QPO at ~0.12 Hz detected in the power
spectrum of the quasi-simultaneous Swift observations of MAXI J1820+070
taken between Apr 16 and 20. 

In the observations taken on May 21-22 no significant QPO was detected.
Despite the weather conditions were poor and the useful observing time
short, we can constrain the fractional rms of a QPO with the centroid and
width of the 128 mHz QPO to be smaller than ~2% (95% confidence).

In ATel #11708, we reported the detection of an unresolved source coincident
with the position of the lensed star Icarus in a single epoch of ground-based
g-band imaging of the MACS J1149 galaxy cluster on June 5, 2018 UT. Given
the possibility of a bright and quickly evolving microlensing event, we
obtained rapid follow-up imaging. In a detailed subsequent analysis using
convolved archival 2011 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS WFC F475W images
as a template, we find that an underlying arc and the lensed star with
typical magnification of up to hundreds (as opposed to thousands as observed
in May 2016) can account for the flux at Icarus' position in June 5, 2018
UT Large Binocular Telescope and follow-up Gemini June 14, 2018 UT optical
images.

As it was noted by some observers, the blazar [HB89] 0716+714 is undergoing
new brightening phase since end of 2017 (see ATel #11107,#11339,#11676)
after report of MAGIC collaboration about its strong activity in VHE (E>100
GeV) gamma rays. We performed a multicolor broad-band photometry of the
selected blazars, using by the 1-meter reflector Zeiss-1000 of the Special
Astrophysical Observatory of RAS (Northern Caucasus, Russia), equipped
with UBVRI filters and CCD camera based on 2k x 2k EEV 42-40 chip. Our
last measurements showed that blazar brightness became in some last days
even higher than it was reported (ATel #11676). The results of our observations
in R-band are summarized in the following table: 

<table border=""1""> 
<tr> 
<th> Civil Date  </th> <th>  MJD       </th> <th> Rmag  +/- dRmag </th>

</tr> 
<tr>

So current brightness of the blazar [HB89] 0716+714 within last 4 days
is near it's absolute maximum value in this century as it was detected
by us in January of 2015 (ATel #6953). We shall continue studies the source

ATEL #11722,"
We report on a new X-ray outburst of the black hole transient 4U 1630-472
based on MAXI monitoring observations and a Swift ToO observation performed
yesterday. 4U1630-472 is a recurrent black hole X-ray transient with repetitive
outbursts (Kuulkers et al. 1997) and has turned into an outburst at least
20 times as reported in the literature (Capitanio et.al. 2015). It is very
likely that it has been inactive for about 600 days since the end of the
previous outburst in 2016 (e.g. Atel#9427, Atel#9462), although we can
not rule out low level activities based on X-ray monitoring data of the
crowded sky region.  

MAXI monitoring data indicates that from 2018 June 7 (MJD 58276) to June
15 (MJD 58284), the X-ray intensity of 4U 1630-472 in the 4-10 keV band
increased from 67.85 +/- 4.8 mCrab to 186.2 +/- 9.92 mCrab, and the flux
in 2-4 keV band increased from 60.06 to 144.74 +/- 9.81 mCrab, respectively.
However, since the source is in a crowded region, it was uncertain whether
the enhance X-ray flux came from 4U 1630-472. 

We requested a Swift ToO observation in the direction of 4U 1630-472, aiming
at determining if 4U 1630-472 is in outburst. The Swift observation was
performed on 2018 June15 from 07:48:02 to 07:52:51 and from 09:26:02 to
09:28:36 (UT). In the XRT observation performed in WT mode, we found a
bright X-ray source located at RA 16:34:01.255, DEC -47:23:26.460, which
is just about 9 arcseconds from the reported position of 4U 1630-472, thus
the transient is likely 4U 1630-472. The X-ray energy spectrum is very
soft, which can be fitted with an absorbed disk black body model with the
best-fit BB temperature at the inner disk edge of about 1.0+-0.1 keV, indicating
the source has already stayed in the soft spectral state. The net XRT X-ray
count rate in the 0.5-10 keV band is 32.8 +/- 0.5 counts/s. From the XRT
energy spectrum, we estimate its X-ray flux as (1.0+-0.11)x 10^-8 erg/s/cm^2
in the 0.5-10 keV energy range, corresponding to about 0.22 Crab. This
is consistent with MAXI monitoring data. We would like to emphasize that
since the beginning, the outburst has been very soft as seen with MAXI
data.  

We would like to thank the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory PI Brad Cenko
for scheduling the ToO observations and the MAXI team for providing monitoring
data to the public.

Gaia18bmt (Ra, Dec = 14:16:03.55, -56:54:48.24) was found by Gaia Science
Alerts programme on 2018-06-11 (http://gsaweb.ast.cam.ac.uk/alerts/alert/Gaia18bmt/)
as a significant brigthening by more than 2 mag on a 15.5 mag star in the
Galactic Disk (l,b = 314.32362, 4.07498).  

Gaia low-resolution spectra (BP/RP) indicate no significant change in colour
of the star while getting brighter. The light curve composed of multiple
Gaia observations shows a fast rise to about G=12.95 on 2018-06-13.13.
The microlensing model (Paczynski's curve) fit to Gaia data suggests Einstein
crossing time tE of about 50 days. The peak of the event is expected to
happen between 14.June and 18.June.  

The target was observed with ESO VLT/XSHOOTER instrument on 2018-06-13.
The high quality spectrum shows a G/K-type giant star with a significant
amount of extinction.  

Further follow-up observations in the next days as the event passes through
its peak brightness are strongly encouraged.

We report the detection of a new transient candidate identified during
routine operations of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266).
The transient, named ZTF18abauprj, was discovered on 2018-06-15.25 UT with
g = 19.4 mag.  

ZTF18abauprj is located at R.A., Dec = 16:59:05.07 +47:14:11.1 (J2000),
roughly 37.5 arcsec (~19 kpc) from the nucleus of NGC 6279. The transient
was not detected in images obtained the night prior to detection, 2018-06-14
UT, to a detection limit of g > 20.9 mag. Adopting a distance modulus of
35.1 mag to NGC 6279, the absolute magnitude of ZTF18abauprj at the time
of discovery is M_g = -15.7. 

We obtained a low-resolution spectrum of ZTF18abauprj on 2018-06-15.39
UT with the Dual Imaging Spectrograph (DIS) on the Apache Point Observatory
3.5 m telescope. The spectrum primarily shows a blue continuum, with weak
features that we tentatively identify as Si II and Fe III. The spectrum
suggests that ZTF18abauprj is a young type Ia supernova. Further observations
are encouraged.

ATEL #11718,"
MAXI J1727-203 is a new transient X-ray binary (ATels #11683) discovered
by MAXI. Rau and Schweyer (ATel #11690) reported detection of a possible
optical/NIR counterpart by GROND consistent with the X-ray position reported
by NICER (ATel #11689). 

We observed the source with Swift/XRT in PC mode on 2018-06-13 from 04:30:15
to 04:49:27 UT. The source is extremely bright causing substantial pile
up with an XRT count rate ~410 ct/s (estimated for grade 0 events; after
correcting for pile-up). We model the source point spread function with
an appropriate pile up model for Swift/XRT and enhance the astrometry by
applying UVOT-derived offsets. Thus we obtain the following localization
for this source:

RA(J2000) = 17:28:29.8s (262.12429 deg)

Dec(J2000) = -20:22:56.5 (-20.38236 deg)

with a radial uncertainty of 1.8'' (at 90% confidence). This is 1.3'' away
from the reported GROND counterpart. 

We also looked for evidence of dust scattering halos around the source.
This is particularly difficult as the source is currently extremely bright
and the point spread profile is too distorted by pile-up to establish whether
a dust scattering halo is present. 

The source was also detected in UVOT in this observation with the following
magnitudes (in AB magnitudes): 

B = 17.17(+/-0.06)

U = 17.63(+/-0.06)

UVW1 = 18.41(+/-0.07)

UVW2 = 19.0(+/-0.1)

ASASSN-18lw (AT 2018cgo; RA: 19:28:50.74 Dec: -19:32:54.02) was discovered
by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al.
2014) on 2018 June 5.92 UT. It was observed with the Southern African Large
Telescope (SALT) using the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on 2018 June 10.92
UT (HJD 2458280.4297) employing the PG300 lines/mm grating. A 1200s exposure
spectrum, covering 3400 - 9000 Angstroms  at a resolution of ~18 Angstroms
with a 1.5 arcsec slit, was obtained in clear conditions with 1.2 arcsec
seeing. The spectrum shows a very blue continuum with broad but shallow
H I Balmer absorption lines, with H-alpha showing an emission reversal
in the core. We interpret the spectrum to be that of a Dwarf Nova in early
decline from outburst, which is consistent with the ASAS-SN g-band light
curve.

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient. 

We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their
continued support of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation through grant GBMF5490 to the Ohio State University,
NSF grant AST-1515927, the Mt. Cuba Astronomical Foundation, the Center

AT2018bym = ATLAS18ohj = MLS180520:184313+451228 = ZTF18aapgrxo was announced
to the TNS by ATLAS (Tonry et al. 2011; ATel #8680) with a detection on
10 May 2018 UT and was detected even earlier by CRTS (Drake et al. 2009)
on 5 May 2018 UT.  We selected this event for spectroscopic follow up based
on its ZTF data (Bellm & Kulkarni 2017; ATel #11266) as available through
the ZTF Alert Archive (https://ztf.uw.edu/alerts/public/).  An optical
spectrum (covering 3800-9200 angstroms) obtained with Binospec on the MMT
6.5-m telescope on 9 June 2018 UT reveals that AT2018bym is a Type I superluminous
supernova (SLSN) at z=0.274 (based on the presence of host galaxy [OIII]
and H-alpha emission lines).  At this redshift the spectrum is well matched
to other Type I SLSNe near peak (e.g. PTF12dam; Nicholl et al. 2013). 
The absolute g-band magnitude in the latest ZTF data is about -21.9 AB
mag.  Additional follow-up observations are underway.

The transient source ATLAS17lbg = Gaia17dbg = AT2017gul coinciding  
with the nucleus of the galaxy GALEXASC J225413.32-214100.1 was  
identified by ATLAS on 2017-08-01 and later by Gaia on 2017-11-25.  
Spectroscopic observations with SALT revealed a blue  
continuum with emission lines at z=0.192 (ATel #11049),  
H-alpha, H-beta and HeI emission lines were composed of  
narrow (<350 km/s) and broad (FWHM ~= 2500 km/s) components.  
No X-ray counterpart of the optical transient was found during   
the two Swift observations on 2017-12-05 and 2017-12-29.  

A new Swift/XRT observation of Gaia17dbg was obtained on 2018-06-08  
(after the solar conjunction gap) resulted in a non-detection.  
However, when the three Swift/XRT data sets are combined together,  
the resulting 4.8ks exposure image reveals a four-sigma (0.004  
+/-0.001 cts/s) X-ray source at the position of the transient.  
The source is too faint to model its spectrum. Assuming  
a power law model with the photon index of 2 and the Galactic  
n_H1 = 1.81x10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005 A&A, 440, 775),  
the observed Swift/XRT count rate corresponds to the unabsorbed  
0.3-10 keV flux of 1.3x10^-13 ergs/cm^2/s.

shows the source remains bright in UV compared to the archival  
GALEX detection at NUV=21.1 +/-0.2 (Bianchi et al. 2011 Ap&SS,

with both AGN and TDE explanations of the Gaia17dbg event.

ATEL #11706,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of the two instruments on the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed renewed gamma-ray flaring activity
from a source positionally consistent with the flat-spectrum radio quasar
TXS 0646-176, also known as 3FGL J0648.8-1740 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS,
218, 23), with coordinates R.A. = 102.1187437 deg, Decl. = -17.7348444
deg (J2000; Petrov et al. 2006, AJ, 131, 1872), and redshift z=1.232 (Hewitt
& Burbidge 1993, ApJS, 87, 451).   

Preliminary analysis indicates that this source went into a high-flux state
starting on 6 June 2018, and brightened over the following days, reaching
a peak daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (1.2+/-0.2) X 10^-6
photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only) on 10 June 2018. The
latter corresponds to a flux increase of a factor of about 60 relative
to the average flux reported in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL). This
is the highest LAT daily flux ever observed for this source, exceeding
that observed during a previous flaring episode in July 2015, reported
in ATel #7833. The corresponding photon index is 2.3+\-0.1, and is consistent
with the 3FGL value of 2.5+\-0.1. 

Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray
monitoring of this source will continue. This source is being added to
the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently, a preliminary estimation
of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi-LAT will be publicly available
(http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/). We encourage
further multifrequency observations of this source. For this source the
Fermi-LAT contact person is S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini@ssdc.asi.it). 

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

On June 5, 2018 UT, we acquired simultaneous g and r broadband imaging
of the MACS J1149 galaxy cluster (redshift z = 0.54) field with the Large
Binocular Telescope (LBT). We report the detection of a bright unresolved
source with a position consistent with the image (or likely counterimage)
of Lensed Star 1 (LS1), a highly magnified blue supergiant star at z =
1.49 (Kelly et al. 2018). We measure preliminary magnitudes of g = 26.9
+/- 0.2 mag AB and r = 26.4 +/- 0.3 mag AB, which imply a color statistically
consistent with that of LS1.  The measured optical flux densities are comparable
to those observed during LS1's May 2016 microlensing peak, when the star's
magnification likely reached several thousand.  A Gemini Director's Discretionary
Time program (GN-2018A-DD-107) for imaging follow up has been approved,

NGC 2617 is typical example of a changing-look AGN.  It has been observed
to undergo a dramatic change from a largely obscured Seyfert 1.8 to an
unobscured Seyfert 1 from 2003 to 2013 (Shappee et al. 2013, ATel #5010,
Shappee et al. 2014).  In Jan. 2016 we began spectroscopic and photometric
(IR JHK and optical BVRI) monitoring of NGC 2617 to see if it was still
in a Seyfert 1 state (for details see Oknaynsky et al. 2016, ATel #9015,
#9030, #9050; Oknaynsky et al. 2017, MNRAS, 467, 1496; Oknyansky et al.
2017, arXiv:171102631O).  In 2016 and 2017 NGC 2617 brightened again to
a level of activity close to that in 2013 April.  However, from the beginning
of April 2017 till the end of May 2018 the object had very low level of
brightness and variability.  In December 2017 the X-ray flux was the lowest
since monitoring began in 1982 with UVW1 = 15.16 +/- 0.03, B=15.60 +/-
0.03 (Swift).  A similar deep minimum was observed in April-May 2018 from
the optical data.  Our most recent optical spectra obtained in April-May
this year showed a very low intensity of the broad H-beta line.

On 2018-06-03 we have obtained a spectrum of the optical transient AT2018cdc
/ DLT18y (ATel #11678) in the nuclear region of galaxy NGC 274 (z=0.005837)
with the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS - Dopita et al., 2007, ApSS, 310,
255) on board 2.3m ANU telescope at Siding Spring Observatory. We classify
the transient as a Type II supernova. We have performed spectral fitting
with Gelato (Harutyunyan et al., 2008, A&A, 488, 383). The spectrum matches
with the template of SN2005gj. Numerous emission lines from host galaxies
are seen on top of supernova features.

Pulsations from the transient Be/X-ray pulsar XTE J1946+274 are currently
being detected with Fermi/GBM. The pulsations were first detected in the
data of June 5.0-6.0 at a frequency of 63.463(9) mHz, with a pulsed flux
of 0.17 +/- 0.02 cnts cm^-2 s^-1 in the 12-50 keV band.  The last outburst
of this source detected with Fermi/GBM began on April 30 2011 (ATel #2677,
ATel #2663).

MAXI J1727-203 is a new X-ray transient discovered on 5th June 2018 14:29
UT by MAXI (ATel #11683), with an optical counterpart detected by GROND
(Atel #11690) and confirmed by the Hiltner telescope (ATel #11691), MASTER
(ATel #11692) and Swift/UVOT (ATel #11697). The nature of the source remains
unknown, though it has been suggested to be a Galactic black hole X-ray
binary (ATel #11696).

We report on optical observations by ULTRACAM on the ESO/NTT (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.378..825D"">Dhillon
et al. 2007, MNRAS, 378, 825</a>) over two nights:

June 6th, 09:21 UT:

Length of Observation: 3600 seconds

Bands: u' g<span>'</span> r' 

Frame Rate: 1.5 Hz (u'), 15 Hz (g<span>'</span>, r')

Signal/Noise: 5-7 (u', g<span>'</span>, r')

June 7th, 08:01 UT:

Length of Observation: 900 seconds

Bands: u' g<span>'</span> i'

Frame Rate: 1.5 Hz (u'), 5 Hz (g<span>'</span>, i')

Signal/Noise: 7 (u'), 16-17 (u', g<span>'</span>)

There was variable transparency, especially during during night 1, and
the target counts were corrected with a simultaneously observed bright
comparison star. The light curves show a lack of significant optical flaring
intrinsic to the target, and no correlation between the faster r' and g<span>'</span>
bands (See link at bottom of page). The fractional r.m.s (on a lightcurve
using 1-second bins) was limited to <3-5% on the first night in r' and
g<span>'</span>, and <2.5% on the second in i' and g<span>'</span>. We
found no evidence of any optical periodicity.

This lack of flaring differs from that seen in other black hole transient
outburst rises, which typically occur in the hard state (e.g. ATel #10820,
#11437). The optical fractional r.m.s during hard states is typically ~10%
or higher on similar timescales in g<span>'</span> and r' (e.g. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.407.2166G"">Gandhi
et al. 2010 MNRAS 407 2166</a>). Instead, MAXI J1727-203 currently shows
a very soft X-ray spectrum and a significant disc component (ATel #11689,
#11697), plausibly explaining the lack of fast optical variations. The
ULTRACAM observations also occurred  close in time to the hard-to-soft
state transition reported by MAXI (ATel #11696).

We note, however, that NICER also reports the presence of significant X-ray
variability on timescales of seconds. The X-ray and optical light curves
thus appear to be decoupled on these rapid timescales.

We also checked Gaia Data Release 2 (GDR2; <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1804.09365"">Gaia
Collaboration 2018 A&A in press, arXiv:1804.09365)</a> for a possible optical
counterpart to this source. Within a search radius of 2 arcsec, there is
a single GDR2 source with designation 4121064315074589696, G mag of 19.46
(+/-0.02 stat.), and no parallax measurement. This is located 1.9 arcsec
to the south-west of the GROND position, and has counterparts in PANSTARRS
as well as 2MASS; it is thus not associated with MAXI J1727-203.

Follow up observations to confirm this lack of variability, and to further
constrain the nature of this source, are highly encouraged. We gratefully
acknowledge C. Clark, T. Cunningham and G. Voisin as the observers for
this run and R. Breton for help with the observations schedule.

ASASSN-18lp (AT 2018cex) was discovered by the All Sky Automated Survey
for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014) on UT 2018-06-05.24 at g
~ 16 mag. It was observed with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT)
using the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on  UT 2018-06-05.75 UT (HJD 2458275.2561)
employing the PG300 lines/mm grating. A 1200s exposure spectrum, covering
3400 - 9000 Angstroms  at a resolution of ~18 Angstroms with a 1.5 arcsec
slit, was obtained in clear conditions with 1.1 arcsec seeing. The spectrum
shows a very blue continuum with broad but shallow H I Balmer absorption
lines, with H-alpha completely filled in. We interpret the spectrum to
be that of a Dwarf Nova in outburst.

ATEL #11696,"
MAXI/GSC observations of the newly discovered X-ray nova MAXI J1727-203
(Yoneyama et al. ATel. #11683, also see ATel #11689,  #11690,  #11691,
#11692) showed energy spectral softening starting from the middle of June
5 (MJD 58274). 
The 2-20 keV X-ray counts has been almost linearly increasing, but the
hardness ratio (4-10 keV/2-4 keV) has changed from 0.80+/-0.20 at scans
from 11:14 to 17:25 June 5 to 0.33 +/- 0.05 at scans from 07:18 to 19:40
on June 6. Thus, NICER (Ludlam et al. ATel. #11689) is likely to have observed
the source at the beginning of the transition.

The current GSC spectrum obviously consists of soft and hard components.
If we fit the 2-20 keV spectrum obtained at 7:18-19:40 on June 6 with an
absorbed power-law plus disk-blackbody (diskbb) model with n_H fixed at
4.6e21 cm^-2 (ATel #11689), we obtained the inner disk temperature of 0.39+/-0.11
keV (the power-law index, Gamma, is fixed at 2.0), or 0.32+/-0.14 keV (Gamma
is fixed at 2.5). Here, due to the poor statistics, we fixed the power-law
index. The diskbb component is dominant below 3 keV in the former case
(Gamma=2.0), and in both cases the diskbb normalization parameters indicate
relatively large disk inner radii, about 200 and 300 [(d/10 kpc)/sqrt(cos(theta))]
km, where d is the distance to the source and  
theta is the disk inclination, for Gamma = 2.0 and 2.5, respectively. We
also obtained the 90% lower limits of the radius, 32 and 29 [(d/10 kpc)/sqrt(cosA)]
km for Gamma = 2.0 and 2.5, respectively. An absorbed blackbody plus power-law
model also yields a similar large spherical radius. An unabsorbed 2-10
keV flux was 2.2e-9 erg/s/cm2 for Gamma=2.0, corresponding to the 2-10
keV luminosity of 1.9e37 erg/s for the 8 kpc distance source.

The ultrasoft component with the rather low disk temperature and the large
inner disk radius (for d > 3 kpc and the face-on disk (theta = 0 deg))
in the soft-state spectrum (e.g., Tanaka & Shibazaki 1996, ARAA, 34, 607)
strongly suggests that MAXI J1727-203 is a binary hosting a black hole.
Further multi-wavelength observations are encouraged.

ATEL #11697,"
Starting on 06:55UT on June 7th, 2018, Swift began at target of opportunity
of the likely black-hole candidate, MAXI J1727-203 (ATEL #11683, #11689,
#11690, #11691, #11692, #11696). In 970s of Windowed Timing mode data,
we detect a bright point source at a location consistent with the optical
counterpart reported by GROND (ATEL #11690), confirming that that source
is indeed MAXI J1723-203.  

The Swift spectrum can be well fit by an absorbed power-law model plus
a disk blackbody. The fitted parameters are N<sub>H</sub> = 0.44 +/- 0.03
x 10<sup>23</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, photon index = 2.5 +/- 0.2 and kT<sub>in</sub>
= 0.46 +/- 0.01.  We note that these spectral parameters are similar to
those reported from a NICER observation on June 5th, 2018, although with
a hotter disk temperature.  

Unfortunately the source lies partially outside of the WT field of view,
making accurate estimation of the flux problematic, however, assuming the
optical position and correcting for the missing part of the PSF, we find
an X-ray flux of 3.9 x 10<sup>-9</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (0.5 - 10 keV,
uncorrected for absorption).  

Timing analysis of the XRT data shows no obvious signs of QPOs or periodicities.

The optical counterpart of MAXI J1727-203 is detected by UVOT, in all three
filters in which it was observed, at v = 16.64 +/- 0.06, b = 17.05 +/-
0.05 and u = 17.42 +/- 0.05 (AB system).  

Further observations are encouraged.

We report on follow-up Swift observations of the AM CVn-type binary SDSS
J141118.31+481257.6 (ATEL #11668, #11672). Based on ground based photometry,
the re-brightening previous to the current superoutburst was reported on
2018-June-1 (https://www.aavso.org/aavso-alert-notice-636).  

We observed the object on 2018-June-7 for ~1ks with Swift using UVOT and
XRT. The object was found to have a UVM2 magnitude of 11.63 +/- 0.02 in
the Vega-photometric system (uncorrected for Galactic extinction). We determined
an X-ray count rate of (2.1+/-0.5)E-02 cts/s in the 0.3-10keV energy band.

SDSS J141118.31+481257.6 has become ~4.3 mags brighter in UVM2 compared
to the last Swift observation performed on May-26, when the object had
a magnitude of 16.00 +/- 0.10 in that filter (ATEL #11672). The current
X-ray count rate is approximately half of that one observed on May-26,
indicating that the accretion flow is again optically thick. 

We thank the Swift team for approving and executing our ToO request.

ATEL #11689,"
Following the MAXI/GSC nova alert of a possible new transient (ATel #11683),
NICER attempted to observe the source at 2018-06-05T15:40 (UTC), within
75 minutes of the alert. Starting at the nominal coordinates reported by
MAXI (with ~20 arcmin error radius), NICER performed a series of offset
pointings, resulting in a preliminary improved source position of 

R.A. = 262.112 deg 

Dec = -20.385 deg 

(J2000), with 1.5 arcmin radius uncertainty set by the NICER field of view.
There are no previously known X-ray sources in this region, confirming
that MAXI J1727-203 is indeed a new transient. The source is clearly detected
at a count rate of ~1500 ct/s (0.35-10 keV) at this improved position,
well above the typical background level of < 2 ct/s in this band. The light-curve
shows significant variability on timescales of seconds, the detailed analysis
of which is ongoing.  

For the two offset-pointed observations (where MAXI J1727-203 was detected),
only a portion of the data was available in real-time telemetry; the remainder
is scheduled for later download. Initial spectra were extracted from these
real-time datasets. The first observation, with a real-time exposure of
475 s, was collected at a ~2.5 arcmin offset relative to the source position
reported above. The continuum spectrum (0.5-10 keV), after applying the
Crab correction of Ludlam et al. (2018, ApJL, 858, L5), could be approximated
with an absorbed power-law plus disk-blackbody model (chisq = 1098.2 for
944 d.o.f.). The absorption column density was measured at n_H = 4.6(1)E21
cm^-2, the power-law photon index at Gamma = 2.47(4), and the disk temperature
kT = 0.20(1) keV.  The second observation, approximately 90 minutes later,
used the improved position and provided a real-time exposure of 340 s.
The Crab-corrected spectrum for this observation can be described using
the same continuum model (chisq = 1346.5 for 944 d.o.f.), with similar
results: n_H = 4.6(1)E21 cm^-2, Gamma = 2.51(4), and kT = 0.24(1) keV.
The photon index suggests steepening but is consistent with the earlier
observation within uncertainties; the change in the spectral shape between
observations may be due in part to the difference between the on-axis and
off-axis response of the instrument. The absorbed 0.5-10 keV flux was 2.60(1)E-9
erg cm^-2 s^-1. We did not detect a prominent Fe line feature in either
spectrum.  

Further NICER observations of this source are underway. Additional multi-wavelength
observations are strongly encouraged.

Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities

emission with the photon index of 2 and the total HI column density  
in this direction to be 2.28x10^21 cm^-2 this translates to  
the unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV flux limit of 1.6x10^-13 ergs/cm^2/s.  

A bright ultraviolet source is visible on UVOT images at

clearly 
shows that PNV J15384000-4744500 is a classical optically-thick nova near
peak. 
H&alpha;, H&beta;, many Fe II lines, the Ca II IR triplet, and the O I

&lambda;7774 and &lambda;8446 Angstrom lines show P Cygni 
line profiles. There is a single absorption line system, with velocity

approximately -470 km/s with 
respect to the emission peaks, and about -485 km/s with respect to the

interstellar Na D lines. Blue-shifted absorption is also seen in various
N I 
and C I lines. 

The equivalent widths of the emission components are H&alpha; and H&beta;
are 
-10 and -0.6 A, respectively. 

The equivalent widths of various diffuse interstellar bands suggest an

interstellar extinction of about 1.5 mag.

ATEL #11682,"
We report an undergoing soft-to-hard state transition of the black hole
candidate MAXI J1535-571 in outburst (ATel #10699).  
After the unexpectedly rapid decrease in the X-ray flux remaining in the
soft state from 2018 April 16 (ATel #11568), the source underwent a hard
state transition around April 30 (ATel #11611). Interestingly, X-ray re-brightening
by a factor of about 400 was recognized on May 16, and the source has been
in the soft state again since May 18 (ATel #11652).

MAXI/GSC also monitored the source in the soft state from May 19, and recent
GSC observations showed that a soft-to-hard state transition started to
occur around May 26 (MJD 58264). The average 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV X-ray
fluxes on June 2-4 were (4.2+/-0.6)e-2 photons/s/cm2 (~25 mCrab) and (2.7+/-0.5)e-2
photons/s/cm2 (~23 mCrab), respectively. The hardness ratio in the 4-10
keV to 2-4 keV band was ~ 0.64. This ratio is a similar one obtained on
October 17-26 (MJD 58043-58052),  
suggesting that the source is still in an intermediate state. We also note
that the current X-ray flux is about 1% of the flux on October 17-26 which
is about one-third of the peak flux in this outburst (Nakahira et al. 2018,
PASJ, submitted).

a resolution of R = 65000-67000. The data were reduced with the SALT HRS
MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068).  

The spectrum is dominated by emission lines of H I, Fe II, O I, Na I, Ca
II, and Si II (see below a full list of the line identification). The lines
are characterized by P Cygni profiles with an absorption component at -475
&plusmn; 10 km/s, characteristic of optically-thick ejecta. We measure
a FWHM of ~1300 &plusmn; 100 km/s (for H&#945; and H&#946;). We also detect
two broad (~200 km/s) Na I (D) absorption features at a similar velocity
to that of the P Cyg absorption, indicative of circumstellar absorption.
Narrow interstellar Na I (D) absorption doublet lines, with at least 4
components, are seen at -30 km/s. The spectrum is typical of a classical
nova in the optically-thick phase.

H I (Balmer): 4102, 4340, 4861 and 6563&#8491; 

Ca II: 8498, 8542 and 8662&#8491;

ATEL #11685,"		Burst, Supernovae, Transient, Variables, Tidal Disruption Event

The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) announces the start of

public alerts. These alerts will originate from the ZTF public surveys

(Bellm & Kulkarni 2017; Nature Astronomy 1, 71) as described at 
www.ztf.caltech.edu/page/msip 

Alerts are generated by the ZTF Science Data System housed at IPAC-Caltech

(www.ipac.caltech.edu) using a realtime image-subtraction pipeline 
(Masci et al. 2018; www.ztf.caltech.edu/page/technical). Newly acquired
images 
are differenced against a reference image to reveal candidate events 
from flux transients, variable stars, eclipsing binaries, AGN, and Solar
System 
objects. The candidates are lightly filtered to remove easily 
identifiable instrumental artifacts. They are then packetized into files

in the Apache Avro format -- a serialized binary format for efficient 
distribution. Each packet contains metadata on the single event 
that triggered the alert. This consists of a unique object identifier;

a machine-learned reliability score; source and image metrics to facilitate

further analysis and vetting; the nearest known Solar System object with

metadata; the nearest Pan-STARRS (PS1) sources with star-galaxy classification

scores and metadata inherited from the PS1 catalogs; metadata for previous

positionally-coincident alerts going back 30 consecutive nights if found,

otherwise, flux upper-limits if the alert position was covered during this

period; and ~ 1' x 1' full-resolution cutouts from the new, reference,
and 
subtraction images. Content details, suggestions for further filtering,
and 
cautionary notes are described in the Data System documentation at 
www.ztf.caltech.edu/page/technical. Documentation on packet usage, examples,

and software is available at github.com/ZwickyTransientFacility/ztf-avro-alert

We expect anywhere from a thousand to >~ 100 thousand public alerts per

night, where numbers (and astrophysical types) depend on the region of
sky 
visited, i.e., galactic and/or ecliptic latitude range covered. Numbers
also 
depend on the available reference image coverage. Alerts are generated
and 
delivered approximately 10 to 20 minutes following observation. 

During commissioning of the ZTF alert infrastructure, 185 supernovae were

discovered. Some of them were known and recovered in the alert packets.

Four known supernovae from three nights are listed below. Their selection

is described in ATel #11615.

Alert packets are transmitted from IPAC-Caltech to the University of Washington

in realtime for redistribution to community brokers. These brokers will

provide value-added services and are responsible for public access. The
brokers 
who have agreed to support ZTF are ALERCE, ANTARES, and LASAIR. These brokers

are presently concluding development and commissioning, and science users

should consult their websites for available services and timelines. Until
the 
broker services become available, users can download a tar file of each
night's 
alerts the following day from ztf.uw.edu/alerts/public/. This mechanism
does 
not currently support realtime access. Furthermore, all alert packets are

archived at IPAC-Caltech. This archive will be publicly accessible following

the first ZTF Public Data Release, which is anticipated in the Spring of
2019. 

ZTF is a project led by PI S. R. Kulkarni at Caltech (see ATEL #11266),

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient. 

We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their
continued support of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation through grant GBMF5490 to the Ohio State University,
NSF grant AST-1515927, the Mt. Cuba Astronomical Foundation, the Center
for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP) at OSU, the Chinese Academy
of Sciences South America Center for Astronomy (CASSACA), and the Villum

ATEL #11687,"
AGILE is detecting enhanced gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV from the blazar
3C 279. 

Integrating from 2018-06-03 07:56:19 UT to 2018-06-05 07:56:19 UT, a preliminary
maximum likelihood analysis yields a detection at a flux F(E>100 MeV)=(7.0
+/- 1.5) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 and a significance greater than 7 sigma.

The enhanced flux was declared in the two Fermi-LAT notices: 

https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/other/1527865315_fermi.txt 

https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/other/1527951885_fermi.txt 

and by HESS in the ATEL 

#11680 

This measurement was obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of the
sky in spinning mode. 
Multifrequency observations of the 3C 279 are strongly encouraged

"
ATEL #11688,"
As a supplement to the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; ATel #11266) public
alerts (ATel #11685) we plan to report (following ATel #11615) bright probable
supernovae identified in the raw alert stream from the ZTF Northern Sky
Survey (""Celestial Cinematography""; see Bellm & Kulkarni, 2017, Nature
Astronomy 1, 71) to the Transient Name Server (https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il)
on a daily basis; the ZTF Bright Transient Survey (BTS; see Kulkarni et
al., 2018; arXiv:1710.04223). 

The filtering criteria for BTS transients are the following: (1) Transient
candidate brightness < 19 mag (in the most recent g or r band measurement).
(2) Transient candidate > 20 arcsec from bright stars (r < 15 mag). (3)
Transient candidate has a minimum of two detections separated by > 30 minutes.
(4) No star-like source spatially coincident with the transient candidate
(we employ a machine-learning star-galaxy separator, based on PS1 data;
cf. Miller et al. 2017, AJ, 153, 73). (5) Galactic latitude cut of 7 degrees.
There is also a final human vetting step to filter out clearly bogus alerts
and stellar alerts that our star-galaxy separator does not catch automatically.

Furthermore, using these filtered alerts, we will carry out an ambitious
spectroscopic survey; we will attempt to classify all transients brighter
than 18.5 mag using the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM; range
350-950nm, spectral resolution R~100) mounted on the Palomar 60-inch (P60)
telescope (Blagorodnova et. al. 2018, PASP, 130, 5003). For ambiguous cases
we will obtain confirmation spectra using other facilities. These classifications
will be periodically announced in future ATels, and on TNS. Here we report
classifications obtained since 2018-06-02.

ATEL #11683,"
The MAXI/GSC nova alert system (Negoro et al. 2016, PASJ, 68, S1) triggered
on an uncatalogued X-ray transient source at 09:41 UT on 2018 June 05.
Assuming that the source flux was constant over three scan transits from
9:41 to 12:46, 
we obtain the source position at

(R.A., Dec) = (261.971 deg, -20.389 deg) = (17 27 53, -20 23 20) (J2000)

with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short
radii of 0.33 deg and 0.28 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long
axis from the north direction is 154.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an
additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius).
The X-ray flux averaged over the scans was 37 +- 8 mCrab (4.0-10.0keV,
1 sigma error).

Since the source is in the direction of the Galactic bulge, (l, b) = (5.2,
8.1), there are several 1RXS X-ray sources in the error region, e.g., 1RXS
J172854.8-202151 (0.24 deg apart), and 1RXS J172903.6-202208 (0.27 deg
apart). We, however, tentatively name this new transient source MAXI J1727-203
because no X-ray nova activity was reported from the 1RXS sources.

Followup observations are strongly encouraged to reveal the nature of this
new transient.

ATEL #11680,"		AGN, Black Hole, Blazar, Quasar

H.E.S.S. observations at very-high energies (E>100 GeV) of the flat 
spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 (reshift z=0.536, R.A.: 12h56m11.1665s, 
Dec: -05d47m21.523s (J2000)) have been carried out over the last 3 
nights on the basis of another strong flare in the high-energy gamma-ray

band (E>100 MeV) detected with Fermi-LAT. 

A preliminary online analysis of the data acquired with CT5 (monoscopic

analysis; telescope diameter 28m) indicate for the night June 2-3 a 
significance of 5.7sigma (in 2hrs of observations), which has risen to

7.2 sigma in 3hrs of observations in the night June 3-4. The rate of 
events appears constant in both nights. H.E.S.S. will continue 
observations of 3C 279 over the next nights, and multiwavelength 
follow-up observations are strongly encouraged. 

Optical observations with ATOM show an increase of apparent R-band 
magnitude from 14.4 for the night May 28-29 to 13.5 for the night June

1-2. In the following two nights, the optical flux has been detected at

this elevated level with variability within 0.3 magnitudes. Observations

of 3C 279 will be continued. 

This is the third time that 3C 279 has been detected at very-high 
energies this year, with a detection by H.E.S.S. in January (ATel 
#11239) and by MAGIC in April (ATel #11545). During this time, 3C 279 
also showed strong optical variability (e.g. ATel #11624). 

H.E.S.S. is an array of five imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes 
for the detection of VHE gamma-ray sources. H.E.S.S. is located in the

Khomas Highland in Namibia. It was constructed and is operated by 
researchers from Armenia, Australia, Austria, the Czech Republic, 
France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, UK, and the host

country, Namibia. ATOM (Automatic Telescope for Optical Monitoring) is
a 
75cm telescope located at the H.E.S.S. site. It regularly monitors 
galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray emitters.

We report that the blazar S5 0716+714 (RA: 7 21 53.45 Dec: 71 20 36.36
J2000.0) reached last night (May 31.83) the optical magnitude R=12.16(0.01).
The blazar is bright in optical since a few months (see ATel #11107,#11339)
and we are monitoring it from the Astronomical Observatory of the University
of Siena since the unprecedented flare in VHE gamma rays reported by the
MAGIC Collaboration in December 2017 (ATel #11100). The following table
reports our last measurements:

This is the brightest R-band optical state of S5 0716+714 measured along
our campaign; similar or lower magnitudes have been reached only a few
(4-5) times along the last 15 years according to the long term monitoring
made publicly available by the Tuorla Observatory at http://users.utu.fi/kani/1m/S5_0716+714.html

Any enquiry on these observations can be addressed either to Alessandro
Marchini (alessandro.marchini@unisi.it)  or to Giacomo Bonnoli (giacomo.bonnoli@unisi.it).
We will continue monitoring the source in the following nights. Multi-wavelength

ATEL #11677,"
On 23 April 2018 INTEGRAL started an out-of-TAC public observation of nova
ASASSN-18fv (ATel #11454, #11456, #11460, #11468, #11506, #11508, #11546,
#11553, #11608). The source continued to be very bright in the optical
band (V~6.8 mag) one month after discovery (20 March 2018), and it was,
therefore, observed with the optical monitoring camera (OMC) in Fast monitoring
mode. We report here one of the few observations using this observing mode.
With this mode, 3 second-long integrations are performed at intervals of
4.5 seconds, and only the sections of the CCD containing the target of
interest are read out from the CCD. On 18 May 2018, the OMC was configured
back to Normal monitoring mode when the source brightness decayed to V~8.5
mag. INTEGRAL observations are currently still ongoing. 

We report here on the INTEGRAL/OMC optical photometric data accumulated
from 23 April 2018 (revolution 1945) to 23 May 2018 (revolution 1956).
The OMC photometric data are affected by time gaps produced when the source
falls outside its field-of-view, because observing is in a 5x5 dithering
pattern by the spacecraft. The light curve shows a general decline from
V=6.76 on 23 April 23:10 (UTC) to V=8.06 on 13 May 05:30 (UTC). The next
set of photometric data started on 13 May 20:50 (UTC) with a magnitude
of V=8.35. Thus, the source brightness dropped ~0.3 magnitudes in 15 hours.
After the drop, the light curve continues the general decline trend with
the same slope as before the drop. In addition to this general decline
at long time-scales, short time-scale variability superposed on the general
decline is clearly revealed in the OMC optical light curve, thanks to the
excellent time resolution of the Fast monitoring mode and the photometric
accuracy of about 0.02 mag (systematic effects not included). In some occasions,
the amplitude of the variability reaches 0.3 mag on time-scales of several
hours to one day. 

Oscillations in the optical photometry of this source were also reported
in ATel #11508, around maximum light on time-scales of days. According
to the classification by <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AJ....140...34S"">Strope
et al. (2010)</a>, ASASSN-18fv can be tentatively classified as a J-class
nova. Light curves of this class are characterized by substantial jittering
above the base level. The variations observed in the light curve could
also resemble oscillations like those seen in the O-class. However, a structure-function
analysis of the OMC light curve indicates that the variability is essentially
random and, as reported in ATel #11508, starts before the peak, while O-class
novae are characterized by quasi-periodic oscillations which generally
start around 3 mag below the peak. Future observations should help in the
definitive classification of ASASSN-18fv. 

Due to the long INTEGRAL ToO program on ASASSN-18fv, the OMC is collecting
a legacy set of well calibrated optical data on the source. The INTEGRAL/OMC
optical light curve and additional information can be found at <a href=""https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/integral/pom-generation?p_p_id=48_INSTANCE_cPRGXJw9FQjM&_48_INSTANCE_cPRGXJw9FQjM_iframe_yr=2018&_48_INSTANCE_cPRGXJw9FQjM_iframe_mon=06&_48_INSTANCE_cPRGXJw9FQjM_iframe_extn=jpg"">
INTEGRAL Picture of the Month (June 2018)</a>. 

INTEGRAL will continue monitoring the source over the upcoming revolutions,
so new OMC optical photometric observations will be available in the near
future. 

We thank the INTEGRAL Science and Mission Operations Centres for their
effort in making these observations possible.

We report the discovery of DLT18y/AT 2018cdc, which was first imaged by
the PROMPT5 0.41m telescope at CTIO on 2018 June 01.42 (UT) at r~16.9 mag
during the ongoing D<40 Mpc (DLT40) sub-day cadence supernova search. A
confirmation image was obtained on 2018 June 01.83 (UT) with the PROMPT
telescope at Meckering Observatory, with an r~17.05 mag. DLT18y is located
at RA: 00:51:05.24 DEC: -07:03:47.0 (~0.9 arcmin from the potential host
galaxy NGC274). We do not detect the transient on 2018 Jan 06.35 (UT) or
in prior imaging of the field. Since there is such a large gap between
observations, and that the magnitude declines in our two detections, there
is a chance that this is an older SN. All images were taken in a 'Clear'
(PROMPT5) or 'Open' (PROMPT-MO) filter which was calibrated to an approximate
r-band magnitude. Further observations are encouraged.

ePESSTO, the extended Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey for Transient Objects
(see Smartt et al. 2015, A&A, 579, 40 http://www.pessto.org), reports a
reclassification of SN2018bsz (RA=16:09:39.19, DEC=-32:03:45.2). 

SN2018bsz was discovered (ATEL#11660) by the All Sky Automated Survey for
SuperNovae ASAS-SN (see Shappee et al. 2014, ApJ, 788, 48 and http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~assassin/index.shtml)
and also recovered by the ATLAS survey, see Tonry et al. (2011, PASP, 123,
58) and Tonry et al. (ATel #8680). 

Initial spectral classifications of SN2018bsz were reported by both Hiramatsu
et al. (TNS Classification Report: 2018TNSCR.679....1H) and ePESSTO (ATEL#11659)
(both spectra can be found on wiserep: https://wiserep.weizmann.ac.il).
Both classified the transient as a young type II supernova (SNII) due to
the presence of a strong P-Cygni profile consistent in wavelength with
H-alpha. However, later inspection of the spectra have revealed features
that cast doubt on a SNII classification: no other Balmer lines are observed;
a broad emission feature is seen redwards of H-alpha; there are a number
of P-Cygni profiles observed between 4000 and 5000 Angstroms that are not
usually observed in spectra of young SNeII. 
We tentatively identify CII lines (4745, 5890, 6580 and 7234 Angstroms)
with blue-shifted absorption troughs at around 13,000 kms-1. Such lines
have been predicted previously by spectral models of Super-Luminous SNe
(SLSNe, see Dessart et al. 2012, MNRAS, 426 26), but are rarely detected
at such strength. A number of spectral features are observed between 4000
and 5000 Angstroms, however the emission peaks appear offset in wavelength
from the lines usually identified as OII in SLSNe. 
By comparing with spectra of other SLSNe I (using SNID: Blondin & Tonry,
2007, ApJ, 666, 1024),  
we obtain good matches with several objects including PTF12dam at -15 days
and PTF09atu at -20 days. 

Inspecting the ATLAS photometry reveal a current o-band magnitude of 15.4
that translates to an absolute magnitude of almost -20 at the distance
of the host galaxy. The ATLAS photometry also suggests that the transient
is still rising (last photometry obtained four days ago). SN2018bsz was
first detected by ATLAS at an o-band magnitude of 18.2+/-0.2 on MJD 58219,
and there is a non-detection on MJD 58207 that constrains the explosion
to have occurred around 50 days ago. 

We conclude that SN2018bsz is a type I SLSN with strong CII spectral features.
Given a host galaxy  
redshift of 0.0267, this makes SN2018bsz the lowest-redshift SLSN to date.
Given this reclassification, we may expect SN2018bsz to rise to be as bright
as 14th apparent magnitude. 

Further multi-wavelength observations are strongly encouraged.

ATEL #11675,"


On 2018-05-28-04:24:00.9 UTC (2018-05-28.18334375), UTMOST found a new
FRB as part of the ongoing search program at the Molonglo Radio Telescope
(see <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PASA...34.e045B""> Bailes
et al. 2017</a>). This is the sixth Molonglo FRB overall (See ATel#<a href=""http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=10867"">10867</a>,
ATel #<a href=""http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=10697"">10697</a>
and Caleb et al. 2017, MNRAS, 468, 3746). The FRB was discovered in real
time, and voltage capture was successfully triggered (see<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05697"">
Farah et al. 2018</a>). 

The dispersion measure (DM) of the FRB is: 899 pc cm^-3, which is substantially
in excess of the Galactic DM as estimated by the <a href=""http://www.nrl.navy.mil/rsd/RORF/ne2001/"">
NE2001</a> model (~69 pc cm^-3). The upper limit on the DM-inferred redshift
is thus ~0.7. The S/N in the detection beam is 14, and a preliminary estimate
of the event's fluence is ~ 18 +/- 4 Jyms. This is a lower limit as the
event's position is poorly constrained in the North-South direction within
the primary beam. The FRB's estimated width (full width half power) is
1.3 ms.  

Source localisation is excellent in the Right Ascension (~ 5 arcsec at
1-sigma) but poor in Declination (~1.2 deg at 1-sigma). The most likely
position is RA = 06:38:48.7, DEC = -49:53:59, J2000, Galactic: Gl = 258.87
deg, Gb = -22.35 deg. The 95% confidence localisation arc is as follows:

6.642039 -53.065500 

6.642700 -52.664778

6.650539 -47.054389 

6.651011 -46.653667  

A formula describing the localisation arc is:

RA = 6.39652461344 - 0.00642068726059*(DEC - 49.8996671717) - 3.9200674396e-05*(DEC
-49.8996671717)**2

Where RA is in hours, DEC is in deg, and is valid in the DEC range [-54,-46]

We have performed Swift follow-up observations of the AM CVn-type system
SDSS J141118.31+481257.6 after its first detected optical outburst (ATel
#11668). We observed the object on 2018-May-24 and 2018-May-26 in X-rays
and UV (~1 ks each observation). The binary was found to have magnitudes
of 15.06 +/- 0.06 and 16.00 +/- 0.10 in UVM2 (in the Vega-photometric system),
respectively. It has faded by ~4.5 mags in that UV filter since 2018-May-22,
indicating that it is going back to quiescence. While the UV brightness
of the object has decreased, its X-ray count rate has increased. We measured
count rates in the 0.3-10 keV band of (2.2 +/- 0.5)E-02 cts/s and (4.7
+/- 0.8)E-02 cts/s, respectively. There is therefore an increase by a factor
of 2.9 in the X-ray flux since 2018-May-23, suggesting that the accretion
flow has become optically thin.  

We are grateful to the Swift team for its fast response to our ToO request.

We report the spectroscopic classification of SN 2018bwq (RA=21:29:11.76,
DEC=-29:09:46.2) in the galaxy 2MASX J21291210-2909468. The candidate was
discovered by the SkyMapper Transient (SMT) survey (Scalzo et al. 2017,
PASA, 34:30) on UT 2018-05-13 15:34 UT at ~19.32 mag in the r-band. SMT
utilizes the 268-Mpix camera on the SkyMapper 1.3-m telescope at Siding
Spring Observatory near Coonabarabran, NSW, Australia (Keller et al., 2007,
PASA, 24, 1). The object was photometrically discovered by citizen scientists
as part of the Zooniverse Supernova Sighting Project.  

Observations were performed on the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding
Spring Observatory on 2018-05-22 16:29 UT, using KOALA+AAOmega and grisms
580V+385R (3700-5700A and 6100-9300A). Classification was  done with SNID
(Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), and the spectrum is available
at the IAU Transient Name Server (see https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/).
The spectrum shows the Si II 6355A absorption, and MgII, and FeII absorption
features characteristic of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). SNID gives a reasonable
fit to all its main spectral features with spectra of normal and 91T-like
SNe Ia a few days before peak brightness placed at redshift ~0.08, consistently
with that of the host galaxy (0.084). We measure a Si II 6355 velocity
of -9,500 km/s.

We report Swift observations of the AM CVn-type system SDSS J141118.31+481257.6
(RA=14:11:18.31, Dec=+48:12:57.6) during its first ever recorded outburst.
The system was detected by Tadashi Kojima on 2018-May-20 with a V magnitude
of 12.6 +- 0.2 (http://ooruri.kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp/mailarchive/vsnet-alert/22176),
an increase of ~7 mags compared to any previous measurement in the same
filter. 

Using the XRT and UVOT instruments, we performed short observations (~1ks
each) from 2018-May-21 to 2018-May-23. The source was found to have an
X-ray count rate in the 0.3-10 keV band of (3.8 +/- 0.7)E-02 cts/s,  (3.0
+/- 0.6)E-02 cts/s and (1.6 +/- 0.5)E-02 cts/s, respectively. In quiescence,
the system has a count rate of (3.3 +/- 1.1)E-03 cts/s in the same energy
band (Evans et al. 2014). 

On the Swift/UVOT Vega-based photometric system, the object had <11 mags
(saturated) in the filter UVW1 on 2018-May-21, 11.53 +/- 0.02 mags in the
UVM2 filter on 2018-May-22, and 12.38 +/- 0.02 mags also in UVM2 on 2018-May-23
(magnitudes are uncorrected for Galactic reddening). A comparison to archival
observations taken during quiescence shows that the system was brighter
by at least 7 mags in UVW1 on 2018-May-21, and it is currently brighter
by ~5.3 mags in UVM2. During outburst, the increase in the optical and
UV flux is much higher than in the X-ray flux. This suggests that the system
is in a high state with an optically thick accretion flow. However, the
current fluxes have decreased compared to the ones of 2018-May-21 and May-22,
indicating that the object might be returning to quiescence.  

We thank the Swift team for approving and promptly executing the ToO.

explosion epoch (sensitive down to M_o ~ -15 mag). <br /> 
(2) Normal Type Ia SN. <br /> 
(3) Young Type II SN, about 1 week after the explosion. He I is very strong,
and there is no trace of Fe II lines. Relatively red likely due to some
line of sight extinction. <br /> 
(4) Blue continuum with a Halpha emission feature at z = 0. <br /> 
(5) Red continuum, with a forest of narrow metal lines in absorption. The
spectrum is similar to that of a K-type star, an Fe nova or even a luminous
red nova at later stages. Assuming that NGC 45 (d = 6.6 Mpc) is the host
galaxy of AT2018bwo, this would provide an absolute magnitude of -12.67
mag for the transient, which makes the luminous red nova classification
more plausible.

6 and May 19 observations.  Excitation of the emission line gas was fairly
low during this period with C I, N I, O I lines were still present in the
spectrum and the He I lines just emerging.  The strongest emission  features
were H-alpha and the O I lines at 0.8446 and 1.1287 microns.  The latter
transitions are excited by Lyman Beta fluorescence and their relative strengths,
together with the O I transition at 1.3165 microns, indicate a reddening
value of E(B-V) = 0.55 +- 0.15.  This extinction is interstellar in origin
as there was no indication of dust present in the nova ejecta.  Line widths
were approximately 1400 km/sec as measured from their full width half maxima.

We report the spectroscopic classification of SN 2018bwp (RA=13:25:54.77,
DEC=-37:14:12.05) in the galaxy 2MASX J13255427-3714139 . The candidate
was discovered by the SkyMapper Transient (SMT) survey (Scalzo et al. 2017,
PASA, 34:30) on UT 2018-05-04 09:50 UT at ~19.1 mag in the r-band. SMT
utilizes the 268-Mpix camera on the SkyMapper 1.3-m telescope at Siding
Spring Observatory near Coonabarabran, NSW, Australia (Keller et al., 2007,
PASA, 24, 1). The object was photometrically discovered by citizen scientists
as part of the Zooniverse Supernova Sighting Project. 

Observations were performed on the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding
Spring Observatory on 2018-05-23 13:46 UT, using KOALA+AAOmega and grisms
580V+385R (3700-5700A and 6100-9300A). Classification was done with SNID
(Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), and the spectrum is available
at the IAU Transient Name Server (see https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018bwp).
The spectrum shows typical broad features characteristic of type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia) past-maximum light. SNID gives a relible fits to all its main
spectral features with spectra of normal SNe Ia at ~3 weeks after peak
brightness placed at redshift consistent with that of the host galaxy (0.065).
We measure a Si II 6355 velocity of -8,700 km/s.

We report of Swift observations of 2MASS J070931-353746 which was 
discovered as a bright X-ray source during an XMM slew on 
2018-April-26. Compared with the flux seen during the ROSAT All Sky 
Survey (Voges et al. 1999) the source appeared to be brighter by a 
factor of about 16. We performed a short 1ks Swift observation of 
2MASS J070931-353746 on 2018-May-18. The X-ray spectral analysis 
found a rather flat X-ray spectrum with Gamma=1.55+/-0.25 and a  
flux in the 0.3-10 keV band of (5.27+/-0.81)e-15 W m^-2, which is 
comparable to the flux found during the XMM slew.  
2MASS J070931.8-353746 had previously been observed by Swift as part 
of a fillin program to follow sources detected in the Second Palermo 
BAT survey (Cusumano et al. 2010, A&A 524, 64) in 2013 July. During 
these observations the source appeared to be brighter by a factor of 
2 compared with our most recent observation. The UVOT enhanced X-ray  
position  (Goad et al. 2007, A&A 476, 1401; Evans et al., 2009,  
MNRAS 397, 1177) based on all XRT observation is  
Ra-2000=07 09 31.8, 
Dec-2000= -35 37 47.8  
with an uncertainty of 2.0"".  

We observed in all 6 UVOT filters and found the following observed 
magnitudes in the Vega system (uncorrected for Galactic reddening): 
V=16.49+/-0.09, B=17.17+/-0.08, U=16.42+/-0.07. UVW1=16.61+/-0.08, 
UVM2=17.28+/-0.11, UVW2=17.30+/-0.08. During the observations in 
2013 July 2MASS J070931-353746 was observed only in U, W1, and M2  
and appeared to be fainter by 0.3mag, 0.4mag, and 0.2mag, 
respectively.   The Galactic reddening in the direction of  
2MASS J070931-353746 is E(B-V) =  0.350 mag (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 
2011, ApJ 737, 103).  

We would like to thank Brad Cenko for approving our Swift ToO 
request and the Swift team for scheduling and executing the ToO 
quickly.

We report the discovery of DLT18x/AT 2018bwo, which was first imaged by
the PROMPT5 0.41m telescope at CTIO on 2018 May 22.42 (UT) at r~16.4 mag
during the ongoing D<40 Mpc (DLT40) sub-day cadence supernova search. A
confirmation image was obtained on 2018 May 22.81 (UT) with the PROMPT
telescope at Meckering Observatory, with an r~16.23 mag. DLT18x is located
at RA: 03:30:25.27 DEC: -23:11:35.38 (~4.6 arcmin from the potential host
galaxy NGC45). Given the distance to NGC45 (D~7 Mpc), DLT8x is at an absolute
magnitude of M_V~-12.8 mag, which means this transient could be either
a young supernova, or a luminous blue variable in outburst. We do not detect
the transient on 2018 May 16.35 (UT) or in prior imaging of the field.
All images were taken in a 'Clear' (PROMPT5) or 'Open' (PROMPT-MO) filter
which was calibrated to an approximate r-band magnitude. Further observations
are encouraged.

In the framework of our EXor monitoring programme dubbed EXORCISM (EXOR
OptiCal and Infrared Systematic Monitoring - Antoniucci et al. 2013 PPVI,
Lorenzetti et al. 2007 ApJ 665, 1182; Lorenzetti et al. 2009 ApJ 693, 1056),
we observed the object VES263 signalled by a recent GAIA alert 
(<a href=""http://gsaweb.ast.cam.ac.uk/alerts/alert/Gaia18azl"">http://gsaweb.ast.cam.ac.uk/alerts/alert/Gaia18azl</a>)
as ""an emission line star undergoing repeat outbursts"" having detected
an alerting magnitude of 11.66 wrt a historic magnitude  
of 12.16. VES263 is located in the Cyg OB2 association [R.A.(J2000) = 20:31:48.84
DEC(J2000) = 40:37:59.9], embedded in a region strongly affected by dust
obscuration.  
It is an entry of both the H&alpha; line emission catalog (SpT B1II - Kohoutek
& Wehmeyer 1999 AASupp.Ser, 134, 255), and the Cyg OB2 imaging survey (B=14.18
-  
Comeron & Pasquali 2012 AA,543A, 101). 
VES263 is identified as 2MASS 203148.845 +403800.10 (J=9.551, H=9.110,
K=8.895) and WISE J203148.84+403759.9 (3.4&mu;m=8.581, 4.6&mu;m=8.496,
12.0&mu;m=8.575,  
22.0&mu;m>8.148).

Our photometry has been obtained on 2016 April 26  with the DOLORES@TNG
Italian Telescope at La Palma (Canary Islands): B=15.09, V=12.96, R=11.69
I=10.22.  
Fluctuations of about 1 mag wrt previous determinations are clearly recognizable,
as also shown by the <a href=""http://www.oa-roma.inaf.it/cimperatore/images/sed.eps"">

	Spectral Energy Distribution </a>, in which black points are the observational
data (bands from B to WISE12 &mu;m), while red points represent a B1 main

	sequence star (normalized to the V-band).  
On the same date we obtained a <a href=""http://www.oa-roma.inaf.it/cimperatore/images/spettro.eps"">low-resolution
optical spectrum</a>, as well. As expected, H&alpha; is seen in emission,
while the other HI lines as well as NaI are in absorption.  
H&alpha; integrated flux 
2E-13 erg/cm-2/s) provides a value for the mass accretion rate of (6.0
&plusmn; 1)E-8 M_sun/yr, by applying the relationship given by Gullbring
et al. 1998, ApJ 492, 323 and adopting M=1M_sun and R=3 R_sun  
for the stellar mass and radius, respectively. Notably, the accretion rate
linearly decreases with the increasing stellar ratio (mass/radius). According
to the GAIA DR2, we obtained a  
distance value of 1680 pc.

The observational results (SpT=B1, H&alpha; emission, obscuration by dust
within a star forming region, presence of IR excess) all contribute to
speculate VES263 is a young Herbig Be star, although it does not look like
a true 
emission lines star. Further monitoring (at optical and IR frequencies)
both photometric and spectroscopic, is in order to ascertain the real
nature of VES263. 
In particular, whether or not its intermittent brightness is driven by
a variable mass accretion rate.

We report the spectroscopic classification of SN 2018brz (RA=08:33:22.27,
DEC=-76:37:39.8) in an anonymous host galaxy. The candidate was discovered
by the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN: Shappee et al.
2014) on UT 2018-05-15 at ~16.5 mag. 

Observations were performed on the 4m Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding
Spring Observatory on 2018 May 19 9:15 UT, using Koala+AAOmega and Grisms
580V+1000R (3500-6000A and 6300-7300A). Classification was done with SNID
(Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), and the spectrum is available
at the IAU Transient Name Server (see https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/).

The spectrum shows the typical ""W"" SII absorption (5454,5640A), and MgII,
and FeII features characteristic of type Ia supernovae. SNID gives a reasonable
fit to all its main spectral features with the pre-peak spectrum of SN
1999aa placed roughly at z ~ 0.019. Velocities measured at the bottom of
both SII absorptions are consistent with -9,500 km/s.

ATEL #11652,"
MAXI J1535-571 is a black-hole candidate in a low-mass X-ray binary that
was detected independently by Swift and MAXI in outburst in early 2017
September (GCN #21792, ATel #10699). The source transitioned to a soft
state in late 2017 November (ATel #11020) and was reported to transition
back to its hard state around 2018 April 30 (ATel #11611). 

More recent Swift/X-ray Telescope (XRT) observations of the source in the
hard state indicated that the source was decaying. On 2018 May 11 the source
exhibited a minimum observed flux of ~1.2E-12 erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (0.5-10
keV; unabsorbed). However, the following XRT observation, carried out on
2018 May 14 (intermittently between 08:42 and 13:37 UT), showed that the
flux had increased by a factor of ~20 to ~2.4E-11 erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s
(0.5-10 keV; unabsorbed). We fitted the spectrum from this observation
with an absorbed power-law model. We fixed the equivalent hydrogen column
density Nh to 4.4E22 cm<sup>-2</sup> (obtained by fitting data with higher
signal-to-noise ratio; see ATel #11611). The spectrum corresponded to a
photon index of &Gamma; = 1.7 +/- 0.3, indicating that the source was still
in the hard state.  

Around the same time as this initial X-ray re-brightening, we observed
MAXI J1535-571 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) on 2018
May 14 (between 16:11 and 21:48 UT). These observations were taken at 5.5
and 9 GHz (simultaneously) with a bandwidth of 2 GHz at each frequency.
We used PKS 1934-638 for primary calibration and 1520-58 for phase calibration.
Following standard procedure in CASA (v4.7.2; McMullin et al. 2007, ASPC,
376, 127) the data were reduced then imaged (using natural weighting).
We significantly detected the source at both frequencies. Fitting a point
source in the image plane we measure flux densities of 0.89 +/- 0.02 mJy
at 5.5 GHz and 1.04 +/- 0.02 mJy at 9 GHz. The radio spectral index of
&alpha; = 0.3 +/- 0.1, where S<sub>nu</sub> &prop; nu<sup>&alpha;</sup>,
is consistent with emission from a compact jet during a hard X-ray state.

The most recent XRT observation, observed on 2018 May 18 (intermittently
between 02:28 and 12:04 UT), indicated that the source had brightened further,
by a factor of ~400 corresponding to a flux of ~9.8E-9 erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s
(0.5-10 keV; unabsorbed). The spectrum was fit by a photon index of &Gamma;
= 4.7 +/- 0.2 (Nh fixed to 4.4E22 cm<sup>-2</sup>), indicating that the
source may have transitioned to a soft state. Close in time to this second
XRT observation, we observed MAXI J1535-571 with ATCA and the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The ATCA observations were taken
on 2018 May 17 (between 06:54 and 11:00 UT) and followed the same setup
and procedures described above. With these radio observations, we do not
detect the source at either 5.5 or 9 GHz, with 3-sigma upper-limits of
0.06 mJy/beam at 5.5 GHz and 0.1 mJy/beam at 9 GHz. The source was also
not detected in our quasi-simultaneous ALMA observations, which were taken
at 97, 140 and 230 GHz, with 8 GHz of bandwidth at each frequency. All
three bands were observed on May 17, where the 97 GHz observations were
taken between 01:42 and 02:02 UT, the 140 GHz observations between 08:03
and 08:30 UT, and the 230 GHz observations between 01:09 and 01:41 UT.
All three ALMA observations provide preliminary 3-sigma upper limits of
0.075 mJy/beam in all three bands. These non-detections imply the compact
jet was quenched, as expected during the soft X-ray spectral state. 

Our current XRT campaign will continue to observe MAXI J1535-571 until
2018 May 30. We will request further XRT observations if the source remains
X-ray active. We will also continue to monitor this source at radio frequencies.

We thank Swift, ATCA, and ALMA for scheduling these observations.

(1) The NOT/ALFOSC spectrum shows the ""W-shape"" OII broad absorption features
characteristic for a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) . In
particular, its main spectral features match well with the pre-peak spectra
of SLSN-I Gaia17biu/SN 2017egm (Bose et al. 2018) placed roughly at z ~
0.08. The redshift is consistent with that of a tentative narrow H-alpha
line likely from the host galaxy. Its very blue continuum and the ASAS-SN
light curve also suggest that it is pre- or near maximum. The absolute
optical magnitude is about -20.7, which is consistent with a SLSN-I before
or near the peak. A subsequent spectrum taken on 2018-05-18.38 by Spectral
Classification of Astronomical Transients (SCAT) survey utilizing the SuperNova
Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) on the University of Hawaii 88-inch
telescope is consistent with the NOT spectrum.

ATEL #11649,"
ASASSN-17mt (Nova Vel 2017) was discovered on 2017 September 24.39 (ATEL
#10772). A weak &gamma;-ray source was subsequently detected by Fermi-LAT
starting on 2017 October 24 (ATEL #10977). X-ray data collected by the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory between 2017 November and 2018 January showed
a faint source (mean count rate = 0.05 count s<sup>-1</sup>), heavily absorbed
[N<sub>H</sub> = (2.0 +0.3/-0.4)&times;10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>
if fitted with an optically-thin APEC of kT = 1.6 +0.3/-0.2 keV]. 

Photometry from the dual-channel photometer on the 1.3m telescope of SMARTS
shows no obvious sign 
of dust formation between days 70 and 240 after discovery. 
Spectra obtained with the Chiron echelle spectrograph (R=27,800) on the
SMARTS 1.5m telescope 
show the evolution from an optically-thick Fe II spectrum with multiple

absorption systems in December into a nebular spectrum in April/May. 
The emission lines of H and He have narrow central 
cores superposed on the normal double-horned profiles. 
Prominent forbidden lines include [N II], [Fe VII], [Fe X], and [Ca V].

[O III] 4959/5007 is very weak. 

Following the detection of [Fe X] emission, a Swift observation was requested
in order to determine whether a super-soft source had become detectable,
as the presence of [Fe X] can suggest. 1 ks of data was obtained on 2018
May 16 (234 days after discovery), showing enhanced emission below ~0.8
keV. While there are only 28 source counts in the spectrum, this suggests
the emergence of a new, soft component, which can be approximately parameterised
with a blackbody of temperature kT = 28 +57/-19 eV, together with APEC
kT > 2.4 keV and a decreased, although poorly constrained, column density
of N<sub>H</sub> = (3.5 +5.9/-3.4)&times;10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>.
The 0.3-10 keV observed (unabsorbed) flux from this fit is 1.7&times;10<sup>-12</sup>
(6.2&times;10<sup>-11</sup>) erg cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>; the BB
component contributes 2.1&times;10<sup>-13</sup> erg cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>
of the observed flux. 

The UVOT magnitudes obtained on May 16 are u = 14.65 &plusmn; 0.04, uvw1
= 15.64 &plusmn; 0.06, uvm2 = 18.09 &plusmn; 0.16 and uvw2 = 16.64 &plusmn;
0.08. OIR magnitudes from May 15 are B = 14.56, V = 13.80,  R = 11.91,
I = 12.10, J = 9.91, H = 9.46 and K = 8.45, with 
uncertainties of 0.02 mag at J, and < 0.01 mag elsewhere. 

The Swift UVOT photometry shows a pronounced minimum in uvm2 (2246 &Aring;)
which may be due to the bump in the Galactic  reddening law. The photometry
in the three UV and u bands forms a straight slope when adopting a reddening
correction using the Cardelli law with E(B-V) = 1.0 &plusmn; 0.1 (Rv =
3.1). This reddening is consistent with the column density measured from
the X-ray data. 

Further Swift observations are planned to monitor the super-soft  
We thank the Swift PI, Brad Cenko, for approving the observations, and
the Swift planning and operations teams for their ongoing support.

We obtained an optical spectrum (range 350-890 nm) of SN 2018bsn, discovered
by the Tsinghua-NAOC Transient Survey (TNTS), on UT May 17.7 2018 with
the 2.4 m telescope (LJT + YFOSC) at Lijiang Observatory of Yunnan Observatories
(YNAO). The spectrum is consistent with a type Ia supernova at a few days
before the maximum light. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova
spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry
2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 1989B at t = -7 days

from the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift of 0.059 for its
host galaxy 2MASX J14572815+0550375, an expansion velocity of about 14,000
km/s can be derived from the absorption minimum of Si II 635.5 nm. The

ATEL #11646,"
Following the detection of CXOU J173324.6-332321 as a new transient X-ray
source in the globular cluster Liller 1 (ATel #11598), we acquired radio
observations with the VLA to classify the source via its radio emission.
The VLA was on source (in its most extended, A configuration), targeting
near the Chandra X-ray position, between 06:22:49-07:07:36 UTC on 2018
May 14 (MJD~58252.28) with a total exposure of 26 min. We took data using
two 2048-MHz basebands centred at 9 and 11 GHz. The source was observed
at low elevations (~12-16 degrees), elongating the radio beam to 1.0x0.21
arcseconds (at a position angle of -31 deg) at 10 GHz. 

We marginally detected an unresolved point source combining both basebands.
Fitting the data to a point source model in the image plane, we derive
a preliminary flux density of 19.3 +/- 5.3 &mu;Jy/beam across 8-12 GHz.
The luminosity of the radio source (L_R = &nu; L_&nu;) is 7.8e27 (d/8.2
kpc)^2 at 5 GHz, where we assume a flat radio spectral index and d is the
distance to the source (scaled to the Harris 1996, AJ, 112, 1487; 2010
edition distance of Liller 1). This source is preliminarily located at</br>

RA=17h:33:24.5931 +/- 0.0039s</br> 
Dec=-33:23:20.65 +/- 0.12 ""</br>, 
0.8"" away from the Chandra position (which had an absolute astrometric
error of 0.6""). Based on the X-ray positions in Homan et al. (2018; ATel
#11598) and the radio position of the Rapid Burster from Moore et al. (2000;
ApJ 532, 1181), the X-ray position of CXOU J173324.6-332321 is 
RA=17h:33:24.61 +/- 0.007s</br> 
Dec=-33:23:21.2 +/- 0.1""</br>. 
Since the radio detection is <5-sigma and outside the corrected 3-sigma
(0.3"") confidence interval of CXOU J173324.6-332321, we are equivocal about
whether the radio source we detect is real and, if real, whether the radio
source is associated with CXOU J173324.6-332321. 

As part of the MAVERIC project of deep radio continuum imaging of Galactic
globular clusters, we serendipitously obtained (A configuration) VLA data
in two subbands centered at 5.0 and 7.0 GHz preceding the outburst of CXOU
J173324.6-332321 on UT April 9 (10:03-11:33). There is no source consistent
with the position of the CXOU J173324.6-332321 or the marginally detected
10 GHz radio source discussed above in a stacked image at a mean frequency
of 6.0 GHz (rms noise 3.0 &micro;Jy/beam).  Hence, on 2018 April 9 we set
a 3-sigma upper limit of 9.0 &micro;Jy on the flux density of a radio source
associated with CXOU J173324.6-332321. 

We obtained Swift/XRT observations on 2018 May 15, nearly contemporaneous
with the VLA observation. The source is about two times brighter in X-rays
than in the observation on 2018 May 06, suggesting either a re-brightening
of CXOU J173324.6-332321 or contamination of the XRT light curve from a
separate, new outburst from the Rapid Burster (or a new transient). Fitting
the new observations with an absorbed power law, we find L_X = 4.7(-0.6/+1.2)
e35 erg/s (1-10 keV), with N_H = 3.8(-1.2/+1.5)e22 cm^-2 and a photon index
of 1.8(-/+0.5). These values are consistent with the (Chandra) values reported
in ATel #11598. 

To make a preliminary classification of the source, we place this object
on the L_R-L_X plane (e.g., Tudor et al. 2017, MNRAS, 470, 324). We note
that a 3-sigma upper limit to the flux density of 15 &micro;Jy yields a
less conservative upper limit of 6.0e27 (d/8.2 kpc)^2 erg/s at 5 GHz (compared
to the marginal 7.8e29 erg/s source noted above). Based on either of these
values and the Swift X-ray luminosity, this transient is inconsistent with
black hole X-ray binaries but is consistent with measurements or limits
from hard state neutron star binaries (see the linked figure below). Hence,
we conclude that CXOU J173324.6-332321 is likely to be a neutron star X-ray
binary.  

We thank NRAO for awarding Director's Discretionary Time and rapidly scheduling
our observations, as well as Swift for its continued monitoring of this
source's outburst.

We report radio observations of the young nova V392 Per (ATel #11588, ATel
#11590, ATel #11601, ATel #11605, and ATel #11617) with the Karl G. Janksy
Very Large Array (VLA) and the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array
(AMI-LA). 

We began monitoring V392 Per with the VLA on 2018 April 30, approximately
one day after the nova was discovered.  To date, we have 3 epochs with
the VLA.  We have observed with both L-band (1-2 GHz) and C-band (4-8 GHz).
Our bandwidth at L-band is 1 GHz, and our bandwidth at C-band is 4 GHz.
We split each band into 2 side-bands for better spectral coverage.  The
total time on source for each observation is about 10 minutes for L-band
and 8 minutes for C-band.   

We began monitoring the nova with the AMI-LA on 2018 May 11, about 12 days
after it was discovered.  Our AMI-LA observations are at 15.5 GHz with
5 GHz of total bandwidth. We have 2 AMI-LA epochs to date, both with total
observing times of 4 hours. 

The nova is clearly detected at 5.0, 7.0, and 15.5 GHz.  There is a marginal
detection at 1.74 GHz in our most recent VLA observation.  Below are the
tabulated results from our radio observations to date.  The reported uncertainties
include statistical uncertainties from fitting the source with an elliptical
Gaussian in the image plane, and a 5% absolute flux calibration uncertainty.
Upper limits are at 3-sigma levels based on image RMS.

The nova is clearly increasing in flux density at all frequencies.  Using
our C-band observations, an ejecta expansion velocity of 4000 km/s (ATel
#11605), and a distance of 3.9 kpc (<A href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018RNAAS...2...24D"">Darnley
& Starrfield 2018</a>), we estimate a brightness temperature on the order
of 10^5 K. The expected brightness temperature for nova ejecta emitting
via thermal bremsstrahlung is 10^4 K.  We therefore suspect there is significant
contribution from synchrotron emission, most likely related to the shocks
that produced the population of accelerated particles necessary for the
detected gamma-ray emission (ATel #11590). 

We will continue to monitor this source at radio frequencies, including
upcoming observations with very long baseline interferometers.  We encourage
additional monitoring at all possible wavelengths. 

We thank the NRAO and MRAO staff for carrying out these observations.

From host galaxy emission lines in our spectrum, we measure a redshift
of z=0.132. At this redshift, the most recent Gaia observation corresponds
to an absolute magnitude of -20.65 mag. Cross-correlation using SNID (Blondin

around maximum light, consistent with a Type I SLSN a few weeks after maximum.

SN 2018ass spectrum resembles Type IIP SN in its photospheric phase, and

The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of the two instruments on the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed high-level gamma-ray activity from
sources positionally consistent with the active galaxy PKS 0903-57 (also
known as MRC 0903-573 and 3FGL J0904.8-5734, Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218,
23) and with the flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 0346-27 (also known as
OE -278, TXS 0346-279, MRC 0346-279 and 3FGL J0348.6-2748). 

PKS 0903-57 with VLBI radio coordinates (J2000.0) R.A.: 136.221579 deg,
Dec.: -57.58494 deg (Fey et al. 2004, AJ, 128, 2593) and redshift z=0.695
(Thompson et al. 1990, PASP, 102, 1235), and is considered a blazar candidate
of unknown type in the third Fermi-LAT source catalog (3FGL). 
Preliminary analysis indicates that on 2018 May 14, PKS 0903-57 was in
a high state with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (2.2+/-0.2)
X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only), about 55 times
greater than its four-year average flux reported in the 3FGL catalog. This
is the highest flux level observed since the start of the Fermi LAT survey.

The corresponding photon spectral index (E>100 MeV) of 2.0+/-0.1 (statistical
uncertainty only) is harder than the 3FGL catalog value of 2.25+/-0.05.
The peak 6-hour integrated gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (2.8+/-0.5) X
10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 was reached by PKS 0903-57 in the interval 12:00-18:00
UT, with corresponding photon spectral index of 1.8+/-0.1. This is the
second time that the Fermi-LAT Collaboration has announced flaring GeV
gamma-ray behavior from PKS 0903-57 (see ATel#7704). 

PKS 0346-27 with VLBI radio coordinates (J2000.0) R.A.: 57.158935 deg,
Dec.: -27.820434 deg (Beasley et al. 2002, ApJS, 141, 13) is a flat spectrum
radio quasar with redshift z=0.991 (White et al. 1988 ApJ, 327, 561). Preliminary
analysis indicates that on 2018 May 13, PKS 0346-27 was in a high state
with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) of (1.4+/-0.2) X 10^-6
photons cm^-2 s^-1, about 150 times greater than its four-year average
flux reported in the 3FGL catalog. This is the highest flux level observed
since the start of the Fermi LAT survey. The corresponding photon spectral
index (E>100 MeV) of 1.9+/-0.1 is significantly harder than the 3FGL catalog
value of 2.38+/-0.12. On May 14, 2018 the daily averaged flux is (0.7+/-0.1)e-6
with corresponding photon spectral index of 1.8+/-0.1. At least one photon
of 30.3 GeV energy is detected in this day to be preliminary consistent
with this source. This is the second time that the Fermi-LAT Collaboration
has announced flaring GeV gamma-ray behavior from PKS 0346-27 (see ATel#11251).

These two sources are members of the ""LAT Monitored Sources"", with preliminary,
uncalibrated estimations of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi
LAT publicly available respectively at https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/source/PKS_0903-57
and at https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/source/PKS_0346-27

In consideration of the ongoing gamma-ray activity of this source, we encourage
multiwavelength observations. The Fermi LAT contact person for PKS 0903-57
is B. Carpenter (carpbr01@gmail.com). The Fermi LAT contact person for

We report light curve observations of the near-Earth asteroid 2015 DP155
which is on the NASA's list of potential future space mission targets (NHATS).
It was first observed at Pan-STARRS 1, Haleakala, on 2015, February 17
and has been classified by the Minor Planet Center as a potentially hazardous
asteroid. 2015 DP155 will pass within 0.023 AU (approximately nine mean
lunar distances) on 2018, June 11; this is its closest encounter with Earth
since 1959. Goldstone radar observations of this object are scheduled on
2018, June 4-17. 

A forced photometry of 2015 DP155 was carried out with the 0.6-m Cassegrain
telescope (Zeiss-600) at the Terskol Observatory on 2018, May 1-7 when
the object had a visual magnitude of about 18.9 and its phase angle ranged
from 70.4 to 74.0 degrees. Analysis of datasets obtained allowed us to
derive a rotation period of 3.105 &plusmn; 0.004 h. The composite light
curve of 2015 DP155 which is shown in <a href='http://aosimon.org.ua/sites/all/files/2015dp155.png'>Fig.1</a>
indicates an amplitude of about 1 mag. Taking into account that the Asteroid
Lightcurve Database (LCDB; Warner et al., 2009, 2018 March 7 update) does

ATEL #11636,"
We analyzed the MAXI observation of the long type-I X-ray burst from SAX
J1712.6-3739 reported by Lin & Yu (ATel #11623, 2018). MAXI observed the
region of SAX J1712.6-3739 during 09:25:38 to 09:26:58 UT 
May 8th 2018 which is about 8 minutes after the peak observed with Swift/BAT
(at 09:18:12 UT according to Lin & Yu 2018). We found that the 4 - 10 keV
flux of this region reached 1.6 +/- 0.2 Crab. The spectrum of this scan
transit is well fitted by an absorbed blackbody model with a temperature
of kT = 1.9 (+0.3, -0.2) keV. The hydrogen column density was fixed at
1.3 x 10<sup>22 </sup>cm<sup>-2</sup> (Fiocchi et al. 2008, A&A 477, 239).
Assuming a distance of 7 kpc which is based on the peak flux of previous
type-I X-ray burst (Cocchi et al. 2001, MmSAI 72, 757), the unabsorbed
bolometric luminosity reached 2.0 (+/- 0.3) x 10<sup>38</sup> erg/s. Therefore,
the X-ray luminosity remained close to the theoretical Eddington luminosity
of a typical 1.4 solar mass neutron star with a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere
(2.5 x 10<sup>38</sup> erg/s) for 8 minutes between the peak of the burst
observed by Swift/BAT (Lin & Yu 2018) and the MAXI observation. Since the
X-ray flux decreased to about 70 mCrab (which is almost the detection limit
of one MAXI scan transit) at the next scan transit of MAXI (92 minutes
after), the upper limit of the e-folding decay time is less than 2000 sec.
The estimated duration is shorter than all but perhaps one previously observed
superbursts (e.g., in 't Zand 2017, Proc. '7 years of MAXI: Monitoring
X-ray Transients', eds. M. Serino et al., RIKEN, 121), but consistent with
many intermediate duration bursts (e.g., Serino et al. 2016, PASJ 68, 95).
On the basis of these results,  we suggest that this is an intermediate-duration
burst defined in Cumming et al. (2006, ApJ 646, 429) and Falanga et al.
(2008, A&A 48, 43).

We report the discovery of DLT18w/AT 2018bko, which was first imaged by
the PROMPT 0.41m telescope located at Meckering Observatory on 2018 May
12.67 (UT) at r~17.0 mag during the ongoing D<40 Mpc (DLT40) sub-day cadence
supernova search. A confirmation image was obtained on 2018 May 12.96 with
the PROMPT5 telescope at CTIO, with an r~16.5 mag. DLT18w is located at
RA: 09:12:26.593 DEC: -58:46:32.14 (~4.2 arcmin from the potential host
galaxy ESO 126-001). Due to the low galactic latitude of this transient,
and its remote location from its potential host, it is also plausibly a
Galactic transient.  We do not detect the transient on 2018 May 11.3 or
in prior imaging of the field. All images were taken in a 'Clear' (PROMPT5)
or 'Open' (PROMPT-MO) filter which was calibrated to an approximate r-band
magnitude. Further observations are encouraged.

discovered by ATLAS, on UT May 08.60 2018 with the 2.16-m telescope (+BFOSC)
at Xinglong Station of National Astronomical 
Observatories of China (NAOC). The spectrum is consistent with that of
a type Ia supernova a few days before the maximum light. Cross-correlation
with a library of supernova spectra using the comparison tool SNID (Blondin
& Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 2003kf at
t=-4 days from the maximum light. Given a redshift of 0.0313 for its host
galaxy MCG +9-14-062, an expansion velocity of about 11300 km/s can be
deduced from the Si II 635.5 absorption minimum. Our classification spectrum

ATEL #11631,"
We call attention on our recent observation of the Gamma Ray source 3FGLJ1454.5+5124
related with the quasar SBS1452+516 (z=1.0831) On March 28th,2018,(JD24582015.0015),
we found this blazar to be in a new outburst. It showed fluxes about 1.5
magnitudes brighter than our previous NIR photometry. On this date the
source had J = 13.445 +/- 0.07 , H = 12.718 +/- 0.05 and Ks = 11.831+/-
0.07, the source is brightest since the time we started monitoring it on
JD 2455689. This source has being flaring in the past, we reported previous
activity of this source in ATEL#3347, ATEl#6282 and Atel#9241. Our observations
are carried out with the CANICA a NIR camera on the 2.1m telescope at the
Observatorio Astrofisico Guillermo Haro, located in Cananea, Mexico. We
encourage further multiwavelength observations.

ATEL #11632,"
We obtained an optical spectrum (range 350-890 nm) of PTSS-18ecg (SN 2018bhb),
discovered by the PMO-Tsinghua Supernova Survey (PTSS, http://www.cneost.org/ptss/),
on UT 2018 May 10.7 with the Li-Jiang 2.4 m telescope (LJT+YFOSC) at Li-Jiang
Observatory of Yunnan Observatories. The spectrum is consistent with that
of a type Ia supernova around maximum light. Cross-correlation with a library
of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin
and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 2008ar at
t = +1 days from the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift (z~
0.0536) of the host galaxy CGCG 21-98 an expansion velocity of about 10000
km/s can be derived from the absorption minimum of Si II 635.5 nm.

ATEL #11623,"
SAX J1712.6-3739 was discovered by BeppoSAX/WFC in 1999 and a type I X-ray
burst was detected with an unabsorbed bolometric flux of (5.1+/-0.5) x
10^-8 ergs/cm^2/s, which led to its identification of a neutron star LMXB
and the estimate of its distance of ~7 kpc, by assuming a  neutron star
with 1.4  solar mass ( Cocchi et al. 2001). It was later classified as
a persistent source by Fiocchi et al. (2008) and it is likely an ultracompact
X-ray binary candidate (in't Zand et al., 2007; Fiocchi et al., 2008).

By investigating the orbital monitoring data of Swift/BAT, we found the
15-50 keV X-ray intensity of SAX J1712.6-3739 rose to 845.7+/-63.0 mCrab
on May 8th, 2018 at 09:18:12 UT, then declined to 148.0+/-31.0 mCrab at
09:24:44 UT and to 87.8+/-23.8 mCrab at 09:32:36 UT on the same day. The
peak bolometric luminosity (0.1-100 keV), if estimated as a thermonuclear
burst by assuming a black body temperature of 3 keV and a distance of 7
kpc, is about 2.3x10^38 erg/s, roughly corresponding to the Eddington luminosity
of a neutron star. This favors the identification of the X-ray flare as
a thermonuclear burst.  

The hard X-ray burst last more than 860 seconds based on BAT monitoring
in the 15-50 keV band. This is much longer than those of typical type I
bursts. The hard X-ray flux declined with an e-folding decay time around
260+/-78 seconds, which is also much shorter than the typical e-folding
decay time of superbursts based the measurements in the soft X-ray energy
band (typically 3-20 keV) (see, for example,  Atel #8253; Atel #9882; Atel
#11422). Ballantyne & Strohmayer (2004) and Keek et al. (2014) showed that
the blackbody temperature of the X-ray spectrum during superbursts in 4U
1820-30 and 4U 1636-536 decreased from ~3 keV to below 2 keV in the first
few thousand seconds, corresponding to the decrease in the ratio between
the X-ray flux in the 15-50 keV band to that in the 3-20 keV band by a
factor of 5,  from about 0.30 to 0.06. The e-folding decay time of the
X-ray flare as seen in the soft X-ray band would be at least 5 times longer.
Therefore the hard X-ray flare detected by Swift/BAT would correspond to
a superburst event in the direction of the ultracompact LMXB candidate
SAX J1712.6-3739. X-ray observations of the source are highly encouraged.

ATEL #11624,"
Optical observations of the flat-spectrum radio quasar Ton 599 (4C 29.45,
PKS 1156+295; z=0.7) with the Automatic Telescope for Optical Monitoring
(ATOM) show a bright optical state. R-band observations conducted between
21 March 2018 and 8 May 2018 with ATOM reveal a continuous increase in
flux from magnitude 15 to 13 &ndash; the highest recorded with ATOM since
2006. This includes rapid brightening by 0.5 magnitudes over 24 hours (between
MJD 58245.4 and 58246.4). Ton 599 has recently shown increased activity
in November 2017 in gamma-ray (ATel #10931, #10937) and optical bands (ATel
#10948). Following that event, it has also been detected by Cherenkov telescopes
in December (ATel #11061, #11075).

Furthermore, ATOM observations of the flat-spectrum radio-quasar 3C 345
(PKS 1641+399; z=0.6) also show an increase in optical flux. R-band observations
conducted between 10 April 2018 and 8 May 2018 show an increase from magnitude
17.2 to 16.0. This is the brightest optical state since 2010. A previous
bright gamma-ray state has been observed in May/June 2017 with Fermi-LAT
(ATel #10453) &ndash; which, however, was not accompanied by a significant
optical counter-part.

ATOM is a 75 cm telescope located at the H.E.S.S. site in the Khomas Highlands
in Namibia. It regularly monitors galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray
emitters and will continue observations of both Ton 599 and 3C 345.

ATEL #11625,"
We have detected a glitch in the Crab pulsar, B0531+21, on 2018-04-29.
The Crab pulsar is regularly monitored with the 42-ft and Lovell telescopes
at the Jodrell Bank Observatory as part of the pulsar timing programme.
Initial analysis shows a fractional rotational spin-up of dF0/F0 = (4.08+/-0.22)E-9
and a fractional change in spin-down rate dF1/F1 = (0.46+/-0.11)E-3 (1
sigma errors). This glitch occurred 176 days after the previous glitch,
which we measured to be the largest glitch ever observed in the Crab pulsar
(ATEL #10939). At the time of the most recent glitch, the Crab pulsar was
still in the recovery phase from the previous glitch. While the Crab pulsar
is observed twice per day for a total of 11 hours, this glitch occurred
between two of our observations. We currently constrain the glitch epoch
to be MJD 58237.357+/-0.005. We are continuing to monitor this source,
but follow-up observations are encouraged in order to help refine the glitch
characteristics and also to identify any radiative effects seen at other
wavelengths.

ATEL #11626,"
MASTER team has reported an unusual object MASTER OT J072007.30+451611.6
in ATel #11620 (T. Pogrosheva et al.). The object was observed at 17.0-17.2m
during 9 minutes from 22:15:26 to 22:24:30 UT on 2018-04-26, but was below
the detection limit (18.8m) 45 minutes before the first positive observation
and 43 minutes after the last one. 

As noted by S. Otero in <a href=""https://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&oid=621224"">AAVSO
VSX entry</a>, MASTER OT J072007.30+451611.6 has an X-ray counterpart XMMSL2
J072007.4+451615. It was observed by Catalina Sky Survey (A. Drake et al.,
2009, ApJ Vol. 696, p. 870) as CSS_J072007.4+451615, but not detected as
a transient. The <a href=""http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/getcssconedb_id.cgi?ID=1146028003321&OUT=csv&SHORT=short&PLOT=plot"">CSS
light curve</a> is showing the large amplitude variability from 16.6 to
21.4m (unfiltered with V zero point). 

Uploading the CRTS data to Period Search Service by Kirill Sokolovsky has
provided the best period value of 0.0627887 d (1.50693 hr, or 90.4157 min
- very close to the interval between non-detections by MASTER at 21:30:39
and 23:07:32 UT). The light curve folded with this period is available
at http://scan.sai.msu.ru/~denis/J072007+451611-phased_LC.gif It is definitely
that of a cataclysmic variable with the large contribution from the hot
spot, most likely a polar. One can even suspect the alternating low and
high states, though not as obvious ones as in <a href=""http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/getcssconedb_id.cgi?ID=1143029055308&OUT=csv&SHORT=short&PLOT=plot"">CSS_J071126.0+440405</a>
= V808 Aur located within 2 degree of MASTER OT J072007.30+451611.6. However,
V808 Aur is an eclipsing polar, and the amplitude of orbital variations
outside the eclipses is about 2 magnitudes. There appears to be no eclipses
in MASTER OT J072007.30+451611.6, but the phased light curve amplitude
is really huge (about 3 magnitudes). This is a remarkable cataclysmic binary
system with an extreme contribution from the hot spot. Checking the archival
data for the low states and follow up monitoring is encouraged.

ATEL #11619,"
The Chandra X-ray Observatory re-observed the field of GW170817 starting
on May 3rd, 2018 as part of its on-going monitoring program (PI: Wilkes).
Observations were split into two exposures of 50.7 ks and 46 ks, respectively.

The X-ray afterglow is significantly detected at an average level of (8.5
+/- 1.4)E-04 cts/s, well below the value (14.8 +/- 1.1)E-04 cts/s 
measured  at ~160 d after the merger (Troja & Piro, GCN Circ. 22374; Troja
et al. 2018). The spectrum is well described by an absorbed power-law model
with photon index 1.5 +/- 0.2, consistent with the value of 1.575 derived
at earlier times from the broadband spectrum. 
By using this value we derive an unabsorbed X-ray flux of (1.4 +/- 0.2)E-14
erg/cm2/s (0.3-10 keV) at 260 days after the merger. The quoted errors
are at the 68% confidence level. 

A comparison with the afterglow models derived in Troja et al. (2018) is
shown at this link: 
https://www.astro.umd.edu/~gsryan/GW170817/xray.png

This new X-ray observation supports earlier claims (D'Avanzo et al. 2018;
Dobie et al. 2018) that the afterglow entered its post-peak decay phase.
However, no clear distinction between the competing models is possible.

Further observations are critical to probe the structure of the relativistic
outflow.

ATEL #11621,"
Recently, the MAGIC collaboration announced the detection of very-high-energy
gamma-ray emission (VHE, E>100 GeV) from the extreme blazar PGC 2402248
(also known as 2WHSP J073326.7+515354; ATel #11548), which redshift was
unknown. Its optical counterpart is located at coordinates R.A.: 7:33:26.81
h and Dec:+51:53:56.0 deg. We obtained a high-SNR spectrum with the 10.4m
GTC telescope within the DDT proposal GTC2018-099, to investigate weak
spectral features from a low-SNR spectrum obtained previously from the
2.5m INT telescope. The observations were carried out on 02/05/2018 with
OSIRIS in longslit configuration and grism R1000B, covering the wavelength
range from 3650 to 7700 A. The redshift of PGC 2402248 was measured as
z=0.065, derived from the identification of several spectral features:
CaII doublet, G-band, MgI and NaD.

We would like to thank the ING staff, GTC staff, the Spanish CAT and the
IAC director for making these observations possible.

< 19 mag (g, or r band). (2) Farther than 20 arcsec from bright stars (<
15 mag). (3) A minimum of two detections separated by at least 30 minutes.
(4) No star-like source directly underneath the candidate (we employ a
machine-learning star-galaxy separator, based on PS1 data; cf. Miller et

ATEL #11617,"
On 2018 May 1th 20 UT (JD=2458240.333) we took spectroscopic data of the
dwarf nova V392 Per (ATel #11588; ATel #11601; ATel #11605) with the echelle
spectrograph FLECHAS (Mugrauer et al. 2014, AN 335, 417) at the 90cm telescope
of the University Observatory Jena. The spectrum is the average of 3 spectra
each with an integration time of 600s, covering the spectral range between
4200 and 8000&#8491 at a resolving power of R~7400. The spectrum is wavelength
calibrated (RMS of is 41.8m&#8491) using spectra of a ThAr arc-lamp, which
were taken directly before the spectroscopy of the dwarf nova. The spectrum
of V392 Per is dominated by very broad emission features, exhibiting complex
line profiles. Beside others the most prominent ones are those of Hydrogen
(H&alpha;, H&beta;, and H&gamma;). The half-width of the H&alpha; emission
line is determined to be 4600&plusmn250km/s. In addition, also strong absorption
features are identified in the spectrum of V392 Per as those of the interstellar
NaI-doublet (5890&#8491 & 5896&#8491) or of the diffuse interstellar bands
at 5780&#8491, 5797&#8491, and 6614&#8491. Simultaneously with the spectroscopy,
we also obtained photometric measurements of V392 Per with the CCD-imager
CTK-II (Mugrauer 2016, AN 337, 226) in the B-, V- and R-band. We obtain
B=8.61&plusmn0.05mag, V=7.83&plusmn0.05mag, and R=6.75&plusmn0.05mag, using
the star BD+47 1026, as photometric reference.

ATEL #11618,"
The Chandra X-ray Observatory started another round of follow-up observations
of GW170817. The first observation (ID 21080) was taken on May 03, 2018
at 10:41:26 UT (t ~ 259 d after merger) for a total exposure time of 50.8
ks (PI Wilkes; program 19408644).   We find that an X-ray source is detected
at the location of GW170817 with a count-rate of (7.7 +/- 1.3)e-4 cts/s
(0.5 - 8 keV) and 13.8-sigma significance. We modeled the spectrum with
an absorbed simple power-law and find a best-fitting photon index,  Gamma
= 1.4 +/- 0.3 and no evidence for intrinsic absorption. The galactic neutral
hydrogen column density in the direction of the transient is, N_H = 7.8E+20cm-2
(Kalberla et al., 2005). For these parameters, the unabsorbed flux is (1.3
+/- 0.3)e-14 ergs cm-2 s-1 (0.3 - 10 keV).  

A second observation (ID 21090) was acquired on May 05, 2018 at 01:25:30
UT (~ 261 days after merger) for a total exposure time of 46.0 ks. GW170817
is detected with 14.8-sigma significance and a count-rate of (8.3 +/- 
1.4)e-4 cts/s (0.5 - 8 keV). The best-fitting photon-index is Gamma = 1.3
+/- 0.3. The corresponding unabsorbed flux is (1.5 +0.5/-0.3) e-14 ergs
cm-2 s-1 (0.3 - 10 keV).   

The best fitting photon index from a joint spectral fit is Gamma = 1.43
+/- 0.15, consistent with the photon index measured at ~160 days. We conclude
that there is no evidence for the passage of the synchrotron cooling frequency
through the Chandra band.   

The total 0.5-8 keV count-rate inferred from the two observations is (8.0+/-0.9)e-4
cts/s.  The X-ray source shows significant fading compared to the previous
epoch at ~160 days (inferred rate of (1.50 +\-0.12)e-3 cts/s, Margutti
et al., 2018). Applying a simple binomial test, we find that the detected
fading is significant at a level > 4 sigma. We can thus reject the hypothesis
of a random fluctuation of the X-ray count-rate, and conclude that these
Chandra observations provide the first statistically significant evidence
for a decaying X-ray emission from GW170817. 

We thank the entire Chandra team for making these observations possible.

ATEL #11614,"
As part of our young stellar object (YSO) sub-mm monthly monitoring programme,
the JCMT-Transient Survey (Herczeg et al. 2017 ApJ, 849, 43; Johnstone
et al. 2018 ApJ, 854, 31), we are using SCUBA2 to monitor the 850 micron
peak brightness of the YSO EC 53 (R.A. 18:29:51.2, Dec. +01:16:39.5) in
Serpens Main (d=436 pc).  The near-IR and sub-mm continuum emission are
variable, with bursts that repeat every approximately 18 months (Hodapp
et al. 2012, ApJ, 744, 56; Yoo et al. 2017, ApJ, 849, 69).  Our recent
measurements at 850 microns and at H- and K-band confirm that EC 53 is
once again brightening. On March 30, 2018 the mean peak brightness of the
source at 850 microns was 1.12 +/-0.02 Jy/bm, within the JCMT (15'') beam.
On April 25, 2018 the mean peak brightness had risen to 1.26 +/- 0.03
Jy/bm, a ~12% increase over 25 days. While the absolute calibration of
the JCMT is typically uncertain by about 10%, the relative calibration
of the JCMT Transient Survey between epochs is significantly better, roughly
2% (Mairs et al. 2017 ApJ, 843, 55). Contemporaneous H-band photometry
from the Liverpool Telescope and K-band photometry from UKIRT's Wide Field
Camera (WFCAM) reveal that EC 53 has brightened by 0.8 mag in both bands
over the last month.  A finder chart and light curves at sub-mm and near-IR
can be found at the URL linked below. 

The YSO EC 53 (Yoo et al. 2017; Hodapp et al. 2012) is classified as a
Class I source yet remains embedded in a significant dust envelope. Hodapp
et al. (2012) first recognized the source as periodic with a roughly 18
month period, based on near-IR K-band observations taken over many years.
The periodicity in the light curve of EC 53 is hypothesized to be due to
variations in the accretion rate onto the young stellar object, possibly
mediated by a companion star or planet forming within EC 53’s surrounding
accretion disk. 

Monitoring observations in the infrared, sub-mm/mm, and radio are highly
encouraged as EC 53 proceeds through this burst. Peak brightness is anticipated
somewhere between late May and early July, 2018. Determination of any significant
lag between the near-IR brightening and the sub-mm brightening is essential
for modelling the structure of the surrounding envelope. Near-IR spectra
during this time are also desirable.

ATEL #11611,"
MAXI J1535-571 (ATels #10699, #10700, #10702, #10704, #10708, #10711, #10716)
has been in a soft X-ray spectral state since late November (ATel #11020).
The source has remained in this soft state down to X-ray luminosities much
lower than typically seen (ATel #11568), and is currently below MAXI and
BAT sensitivity limits. However, recent Swift-XRT observations (taken on
2018 April 26, April 30 and May 02, MJDs 58232, 58234 and 58240, respectively)
show that the X-ray spectrum has now evolved significantly. The observations
show a significant decrease in the soft X-ray emission and an increase
in the hard X-ray emission. 

We measure a (3-7 keV)/(1-3 keV) colour ratio of 0.21+/-0.07, 0.9+/-0.3
and 3.8+/-1.4 on April 26, April 30 and May 02, respectively. We fit these
three epochs with a simple absorbed power law with the N<sub>H</sub> fixed
to 4.4E22 cm<sup>-2</sup> (determined by joint fitting these epochs with
other higher signal-to-noise observations taken in the week preceding these
marked spectral changes), to highlight changes in the spectrum. We find
that the soft X-ray flux reduced steadily from ~2.7E-12 ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s
to ~5.9E-13 ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (absorbed 1-3 keV) over the observations,
while the hard X-ray flux increased from ~5.7E-13 ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s
to ~2.2E-12 ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s (absorbed 3-7 keV). Over these dates,
the X-ray photon index evolved from 5+/-1 to 3.7+/-0.8, and then 1.6+/-0.6.
We note that while there is an obvious trend in the data, the values of
the absorbed fluxes and photon indices are poorly constrained (due to low
count rates and a high degeneracy with the line-of-sight absorption, which
has errors of 1.1E22 cm<sup>-2</sup> in our joint fitting). The addition
of a disk blackbody component (which is preferred for the April 26 data)
does not change the observed trend. 

Following this X-ray hardening, we performed ATCA radio observations of
the source on 2018 May 03 21:46:09.9 UT to 22:39:09.9 UT (MJD 58241.92
+/- 0.02). These observations were taken simultaneously at 5.5 and 9.0
GHz, with a bandwidth of 2 GHz at each frequency. 1934-638 and 1520-58
were used for primary flux and phase calibration, respectively. The data
were reduced and imaged following standard procedures in CASA (v4.7.2;
McMullin et al. 2007). Imaging was carried out using natural weighting
to maximise sensitivity.  

The radio counterpart was not detected at either frequency, with 3-sigma
upper-limits of 165 uJy/beam at 5.5 GHz and 141 uJy/beam at 9 GHz. Stacking
the two frequencies provides a 3-sigma upper-limit of 117 uJy/beam. A radio
non-detection does not rule out an accretion state transition, as the compact
jet typically switches on a few days later than the X-ray spectral changes,
which themselves lag the change in X-ray timing properties by a few days
(Kalemci et al. 2013). 

We will continue to monitor MAXI J1535-571 at radio frequencies. Further
multiwavelength monitoring is strongly encouraged. 

We thank Swift and ATCA for scheduling these observations.

with the ESPERO echelle spectrograph (Bonev et al. 2017, BlgAJ 26, 67)
at Rozhen observatory (Bulgaria), on 2018 May 1 18.74 UT and May 2 18.80
UT. The spectra cover the range of 4400-9000 &#8491; with a resolving power
of ~30 000. The spectrum of the Nova is dominated by very broad emission
lines with a complex shape. The strongest lines in our spectra are H&alpha;,
H&beta;, FeII 42 multiplet, CaII IR triplet, OI 7774&#8491; and 8446&#8491;.
HeI lines 5876&#8491; and 6677&#8491; are relatively weak with an obvious
increase of the emission intensity during the second night. The FWHM measured
for the H&alpha; and H&beta; emission lines is 5600&plusmn;200 km/s. In
their profiles, three peaks with radial velocities of about -2000 km/s,
-250 km/s and 1900 km/s are apparent. Weak P Cyg absorption components
are also visible in the H&alpha; and H&beta; profiles. We measured the
radial velocity to be about -4000 km/s for one absorption component in
H&alpha; and about -3700 km/s and -4100 km/s for two absorptions in H&beta;.
Three very weak absorptions of HeI 5876&#8491; with radial velocities of
about -1350 km/s, -3035 km/s and -3350 km/s are also visible in the spectrum.

The DIBs 5780&#8491;, 5797&#8491;, 6614&#8491; and the interstellar lines
NaI and KI are very strong. The interstellar lines show two components
with radial velocities -23.7&plusmn;1.5 km/s and 3.5&plusmn;0.3 km/s respectively.
Using the relations of Munari & Zwitter (1997, A&A 318, 269) for KI (the
NaI lines are saturated and not usable) and of Puspitarini et al. (2013,
A&A 555, 25) for the DIBs, we derived an interstellar excess E(B-V)~1.18+/-0.10
mag. From Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016, A&A 595, 1; Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2018b, A&A, special issue for Gaia DR2) we can determine the distance
to V392 Per as 3.9&plusmn;0.8 kpc. Adopting V=6.34 mag from the AAVSO light
curve as maximum brightness, for the absolute magnitude at maximum we obtain
Mv=-10.3&plusmn;0.3 mag.

ATEL #11606,"
As part of a search programme for fast radio transients that is running
at the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory, we have followed up
the very bright FRB180309 (ATel #11387). Follow-up observations started
less than 7 hours after the event, on 2018-03-09 at 09:34:51 UTC, pointing
at the reported position centered at RA = 21:24:43.8, Dec = -33:58:44.5
(J2000), close to PSR J2124-3358. Two hours of data were recorded. The
observations were conducted using the L-band receiver, with the Apollo
backend sampling a bandwidth of 336 MHz, centred at 1564 MHz, with 0.5
MHz channel bandwidth. 8-bit filterbank files were produced with a sampling
time of 256 us. 

We analysed the data using two single-pulse search pipelines. One pipeline
is based on the Heimdall algorithm (Barsdell et al. 2011). For the second
pipeline, we used algorithms from Astro-Accelerate (https://github.com/AstroAccelerateOrg/astro-accelerate)
that is part of the ongoing development of highly optimized fast transient
search software for upcoming facilities like MeerKAT and the Square Kilometre
Array. Our preliminary analyses using both pipelines show no events above
a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 8 for widths between 0.256 - 655.36 ms
(0.256 - 500 ms for AA) and dispersion measures (DMs) 0 - 5000 pc cm^-3
(0 - 750 pc cm^-3 for AA). The non-detection places an upper-limit on potential
radio afterglow emission of 0.6 Jy ms for events of 1 ms duration. The
limit takes into account the fraction of data corrupted by radio-frequency
interference (RFI) and the contribution to the system temperature from
ground spill-over caused by the low elevation of the field for the telescope.

Additionally, we reprocessed about 4 hours of archival data of the field
that were obtained during regular observations as part of the Jodrell Bank
pulsar timing programme of PSR J2124-3358. These typically 15 minute long
observations span the period from 2013-11-22 to a few days before the event
(2018-03-05). Again, our preliminary analyses indicate no single-pulse
events above a S/N of 8 (0.256 <= width <= 655.36 ms, 0 <= DM <= 5000 pc
cm^-3), placing an upper-limit on previous outbursts of 0.6 Jy ms for events
of 1 ms duration. This includes the same additional contributions as above.

Follow-up observations of the field and further data analysis are ongoing.
Part of this research was made possible by the ERC funded MeerTRAP project
(grant no. 694745).

ATEL #11607,"
We report on SALT high-resolution spectroscopy of ASASSN-18ix which was
reported as a possible Galactic nova by K. Z. Stanek et al. (ATel #11561).

We obtained a 2000 s spectrum of this object under the SALT Large Science
Program on transients on 2018 April 24.99 (HJD 2458233.50), using the High
Resolution Spectrograph (HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE, 91476) on
the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Observations were taken in
the Low Resolution (LR) mode of HRS, covering a spectral range of 3800-8900
&#8491; at a resolution of R = 14,000. The data were reduced with the SALT
HRS MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068). 

The spectrum is dominated by weak emission lines of H I and He I (see below
a full list of the line identification) superimposed on broad absorption
lines, typical of dwarf novae on decline. The emission lines are characterized
by a double peaked profiles, typical of an accretion disk, where the peaks
are separated by ~320 &plusmn; 20 km/s. We measure a FWHM of ~550 &plusmn;
50 km/s for H&#946; and H&#945; emission lines.  

A dwarf nova classification is consistent with the evolution of the light-curve
obtained by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee
et al. 2014). The light-curve shows a quick rise to the maximum followed
by a fast decline, typical for that of dwarf novae (see below a table of
magnitudes) and consistent with our spectrum, taken 3.5-4 days after maximum.

H I (Balmer): 4102, 4340, 4861 and 6563&#8491;

ATEL #11608,"
In response to the detection of gamma-ray emission with the Fermi LAT instrument
in the recent nova ASASSN-18fv (ATel #11546), we carried out a target-of-opportunity
observation of the system with the NuSTAR observatory between 2018 April
20 and 2018 April 22.  The total exposure time was ~64 ks.  A simultaneous
soft X-ray observation was carried out using the Swift satellite at the
end of the NuSTAR exposure on 2018 April 22, lasting 1000s.  The Swift
observation utilized the XRT instrument in Windowed Timing mode, due to
the high optical brightness of the nova.

ASASSN-18fv was not detected in the Swift XRT observation, with a 3-sigma
upper limit on the 0.3-10 keV count rate of 0.016 cts/s.  The nova was,
however, clearly detected in the NuSTAR image, with ~2350 net counts detected
in a 50 arcsec circular region centered on the source in both the FPMA
and FPMB instruments.  We find that the nova spectrum is well fit by an
absorbed thermal plasma model (phabs*apec in XSpec), consistent with a
deeply embedded internal shock in the ejecta.  The best fit energy of the
plasma is kT = 7.8 +/- 1.5 keV.  Absorption is seen to be strong enough
to eliminate all photons below ~4 keV, requiring an equivalent hydrogen
column density (Nh) of a few 10^24 cm^-2 if solar abundances are assumed.
The observed flux was 3e-12 erg/s/cm^2 in the 3.5-78 keV range, and the
implied unabsorbed flux was 1e-11 erg/s/cm^2.  We find no evidence of non-thermal
emission at high energies in the spectrum.

Further X-ray observations of this nova are encouraged to monitor the evolution
of this internal shock as the ejecta expand.

We report on the detection of MAXI J1820+070 (e.g. ATel #11399, #11418,
#11420) with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). Observations in the high
band (115-189 MHz) were carried out from 2018 April 27 02:32:33.0-04:32:33.0
UTC (MJD 58235.106-58235.189). Using data from 115-166 MHz and the Prefactor
calibration pipeline (e.g. van Weeren et al. 2016, ApJS, 223, 2), we generated
a preliminary map with angular resolution 34.5"" x 20.3"" (beam position
angle 33.2 deg). We detect an unresolved point source at the fitted position
RA 18:20:21.9, Dec. +07:11:07, after initial first-order corrections for
potential systematics in the astrometry. Moreover, the preliminary 140-MHz
flux density is 42 +/- 5 mJy, determined with the MIRIAD task IMFIT; the
fitting error and an estimated 10 per cent calibration error were combined
in quadrature to obtain the overall uncertainty. The flux density scale
is that of Scaife & Heald 2012 (MNRAS, 423, L30). Our LOFAR flux density
further constrains the shape of the radio spectrum in the metre-wavelength
regime, with our measurement being close in value to the VLITE detection
at 339 MHz on 2018 April 12 (ATel #11540).    

MAXI J1820+070 was also observed by the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large
Array (AMI-LA), simultaneously with LOFAR, between 2018 April 27 02:07:27.3-05:05:12.5
UTC (MJD 58235.089-58235.212). The observation was performed over a 5-GHz
bandwidth (4096 channels), with a central frequency of 15.5 GHz. The data
were then binned into 8 broad frequency channels, and flagged and calibrated
using the custom reduction pipeline reduce_dc (e.g. Perrott et al. 2013,
MNRAS, 429, 3330). Additional flagging, and then cleaning, was done in
CASA using natural weighting and a gain factor of 0.1. MAXI J1820+070 is
clearly detected as an unresolved source in the image at RA 18:20:22, Dec.
+07:11:11 (the synthesised beam major and minor axes are 60"" and 30"", respectively,
with a beam position angle of 10.2 deg), with a flux density of 50 +/-
2 mJy determined using the CASA task IMFIT. The uncertainty includes the
statistical fitting error and a 5 per cent calibration error. 

The instantaneous two-point spectral index, alpha, between 140 MHz and
15.5 GHz is therefore 0.04 +/- 0.03 (flux density S_nu proportional to
nu<sup>alpha</sup>), a value that is consistent with previous reports of
a near-flat radio spectrum (e.g. ATel #11439, #11539).  

We thank the ASTRON Radio Observatory for promptly scheduling our LOFAR
observations and pre-processing the data. We also thank the MRAO staff
for carrying out the AMI-LA observations.

We report the discovery of DLT18v/AT 2018beg, which was first imaged by
the PROMPT5 0.41m telescope located at CTIO on 2018 May 03.35 (UT) at r~17.9
mag during the ongoing D<40 Mpc (DLT40) sub-day cadence supernova search.
A confirmation image was obtained on 2018 May 03.52 with the PROMPT telescope

The progenitor system of V392 Per is discussed in Darnley & Starrfield

This spectrum was obtained by the FRODOSpec instrument (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AN....333..101B"">Barnsley
et al. 2012</a>) on the LT at 2018 May 02.86 UT. We utilised the low resolution

of FRODOSpec, with an integration time of 5&times;60s for both arms. 

The spectrum shows broad emission profiles from the following lines: H&alpha;
&mdash; H&delta; (H&epsilon; is not detected), Paschen 10 &mdash; 14, He
I (7281, 7065, 6678, 5875, 5016, 4471, 4388), O I (7773, 8446), Fe II (multiplet
42), Si II (6347/6371; multiplet 2).  Lines from N II (5001), Fe II (multiplets
48 and 49) and Mg II (4481) are also tentatively identified.  There are
a number of lines that currently defy identification. 

The FWHM of the H&alpha; line is 4700&plusmn;100 km/s, for H&beta; 4200&plusmn;100
km/s.  The Balmer lines and the O I lines (and possibly the Fe II (42)
lines) all show considerable structure within their profiles, with three
(possibly five) individual peaks. 

Due to its current position in the sky, this nova is only accessibly at
around evening twilight. With the observability diminishing, additional
follow-up observations are highly sought after!

ATEL #11603,"
We report the results of spectral and timing analyses of NuSTAR (3-79 keV)
and Swift (0.3-10 keV) observations of the accretion-powered millisecond
pulsar Swift J1756.9-2508, performed during its recent April 2018 outburst
(ATel #11497, #11502, #11505, #11523, #11566 and #11581).  

On our request the source was observed twice with NuSTAR on April 8 and
14, 2018 for 39.5 ks and 61 ks, respectively, and was monitored with the
XRT aboard The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory every other day during the
whole outburst (April 2-24, 2018; 10.2 ks exposure). 

The first NuSTAR observation was performed on April 8, 2018 starting at
08:31:09, when the source was already in the fading phase of the outburst.
The source was significantly detected up to 70 keV allowing us to construct
a broad-band spectrum for the first time. The closest Swift-XRT observation
was performed on the same day (ObsID 00088662001; 2.2 ks) and was used
to cover energies below 3 keV.  
The joint spectrum was fitted with an absorbed comptonized spectrum (phabs*compPS)
under the assumption of a slab geometry. We obtained an excellent fit (red.
chi^2=1.01; 1395 dof; NuSTAR FPM-A,B and Swift-XRT) with the following
parameters: N<sub>H</sub>=(3.9 +/- 0.1)e22 cm^(-2), electron temperature
kTe=(29.5 +/- 1.7) keV, Thomson optical depth tau_T=(2.0 +/- 0.1) and black
body temperature frozen at kT<sub>bb</sub>=0.1 keV. Unabsorbed fluxes in
2-10 and 20-60 keV energy bands are F<sub>2-10</sub>=(2.20 +/- 0.5)e-10
and F<sub>20-60</sub>=(2.60 +/- 0.05)e-10 erg/(s cm^2), respectively. 

No evidence for an iron emission line was found. 

The second NuSTAR observation was taken about one week later on April 14,
2018 starting at 02:56:09, and the source was undetectable in the NuSTAR
data in agreement with quasi-simultaneous Swift-XRT data. 

We also performed a timing analysis using NuSTAR data of the first April
8, 2018 observation. For this purpose a phase coherent timing model, composed
of updated pulsar and orbital ephemerides, was constructed from NICER data
covering the 3--11 April, 2018 period (see P.M. Bult et al., ATELs #11502
and #11581). Adopting the DE405 solar system ephemeris in the barycentering
process we obtained in our 2 parameter optimisation procedure a pulse frequency
of 182.06580384(4) Hz at Epoch MJD 58216 (TDB) and a time of ascending
node Tasc of 58211.01753(6) MJD (TDB). Errors are at  1 sigma confidence
level. In this procedure we kept the orbital period, Porb, projected orbital
size, asini,fixed to the values given in MNRAS 403, 1426 (Patruno et al.
(2010)). A 3 parameter 
optimisation with also Porb free gives a best fit value of 3282.35(10)
s, fully consistent with the value given in MNRAS 403, 1426. 

Folding the NuSTAR timing data (using the latest clock correction information)
on the updated ephemeris yielded highly significant pulsed emission up
to ~50 keV: 3-10 keV 25.8 sigma, 10-20 keV 15.2 sigma and 20-60 keV 7.5
sigma, adopting a Z_2^2-test. The (background corrected) pulsed fractions
are 6.2% for all three energy bands, consistent with the NICER findings
(ATEL #11502). 
The pulse shape does not seem to be dependent on energy, and is fully compatible
with the 3-10 keV NICER profile, though the NuSTAR pulse arrives +0.37(4)
ms later than the NICER pulse (see http://www.sron.nl/~kuiper/ATEL/SwiftJ1756.9-2508/
for the NICER and NuSTAR pulse profiles). 

We thank the NuSTAR and Swift teams for scheduling our ToO observations.

ATEL #11598,"
We report on the discovery of a new X-ray transient in the globular cluster
Liller 1 with Chandra.  

Swift/XRT monitoring observations of the globular cluster Liller 1 in early
April 2018 revealed low-level activity (around 0.1 ct/s) in the core of
the cluster. Liller 1 harbors the well-known transient neutron star low-mass
X-ray binary MXB 1730-335, also known as the Rapid Burster. An archival
Chandra HRC-I observation of Liller 1 (Homer et al. 2001, ApJ, 122, 2627)
indicates that in addition to the Rapid Burster, at least three other (low-luminosity)
X-ray sources are present in the error circle of the Swift X-ray source.
Type-II bursts (Lewin et al. 1976, ApJ, 207, L95), which would have identified
the Swift source as the Rapid Burster, were not seen in the Swift observations
(April 4, 9, 17, 20, 24, and 29) nor in follow-up NICER observations (April
20 and 22). Type-I bursts were not detected either. Prompted by the absence
of type-II bursts, we triggered our Chandra program to identify possible
new transients in globular clusters. 

Chandra observed Liller 1 with ACIS-S in 1/8 subarray mode for ~9 ks, starting
on 2018 April 30 at 11:08 UT. Our observation reveals three X-ray sources
in the core of Liller 1. The brightest of these sources, the current X-ray
transient, does not show type-I or type-II bursts. Comparison with a reprocessed
version of the archival Chandra HRC-I observation indicates that two of
the sources in our ACIS-S observation can be matched with two of the low-luminosity
X-ray sources (C2 and C3) reported by Homer et al. (2001). However, the
third source detected in the ACIS-S image does not coincide with the Rapid
Burster. As can be seen from the coordinates listed below, the offsets
(ACIS-S minus HRC-I)  are (delta_ra,delta_dec)=(+0.1'',-0.3'') for C2 and
(+0.1'',-0.1'') for C3. This is consistent with the absolute pointing accuracy
of Chandra (~0.6''). However,  the current transient is shifted from the
Rapid Burster by an angular distance that is substantially larger (+0.1'',-1.3''),
indicating that the current transient corresponds to a previously unidentified
X-ray source in Liller 1.

The formal errors on these coordinates (from wavdetect in CIAO 4.9) are
less than 0.1'' in each direction. 

Following Chandra's naming convention, we refer to the new transient as
CXOU J173324.6-332321. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum of the source can be well
fit with an absorbed power law (when including Chandra's pile-up model).
We find NH=3.8(2)e22 cm^-2, a power-law photon index of 1.9(1), and an
unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux of 6.9(3)e-11 erg/cm^2/s. For a distance of
8.2 kpc (Harris 1996, AJ, 112, 1487), the 0.5-10 keV luminosity is 5.5(3)e35
erg/s. We note that at this luminosity the observed power-law index is
consistent with either black hole or neutron star X-ray binaries (Wijnands
et al. 2015, MNRAS, 454,1371).  

Finally, our results suggest that past low-level activity in Liller 1 (detected
with all-sky monitors, or even the Swift/XRT) that was attributed to the
Rapid Burster may have come from CXOU J173324.6-332321. 

We thank the Chandra staff for their help in executing this observation
as soon as possible.

ATEL #11596,"
I have observed the transient source MAXI J1820+070 in the optical since

2018 March 24.  In the past two weeks, the source has started to show long-term

variations in brightness of amplitude approximately 0.03 - 0.10 magnitude.

Measurements made at the RIT Observatory, Rochester, NY, USA,  
using a 30-cm Meade LX200 telescope, no filter and ATIK 11000 CCD,  
between UT 2018 Apr 22 and UT 2018 May 02, can be fit by a rough  
sinusoid with period of about 0.1417 days = 3.4 hours. 

Since the source is only visible above the horizon for about 3 hours
before 
dawn, it is difficult to separate intrinsic variability of a similar period

from several systematic effects, especially color-dependent extinction.

However, the increase in amplitude on UT 2018 May 02 makes the effect easier

to detect. 

The period appears to be very close to one-seventh of a day, which leads

to some ambiguity; a periodogram shows strong peaks at one-sixth and one-eighth

of a day as well.  In order to break this degeneracy, I added measurements
made 
by Stephen M Brincat (BSM), at Flarestar Observatory, Malta, using a 25-cm

Meade telescope, no filter, and Moravian G2-1600 CCD; these measurements
kindly 
provided by the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO).

Since this data was acquired at a longitude far from that of RIT, it distinguishes

well between these signals.  The data from BSM on UT 2018 May 01, 
combined with the three nights of RIT data, yield a good fit for a period

of 0.1417 days. 

This period may be caused by the orbital motions of the members 
of the binary system.  Further tests of this variation by other observers,

and at other wavelengths, is welcome. 

Further details on the measurements and data reduction from RIT Observatory,

as well as light curves and datafiles in ASCII format, can be found in
the nightly report 
linked below.

ATEL #11597,"		Object, Potentially Hazardous Asteroid

The Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) 2013 US3 was discovered on October 24 2013
by the Mt. Lemmon Survey (MPEC 2013-U46) and has been identified as a Potentially
Hazardous Asteroid (PHA) as well as a possible spacecraft mission target
(NHATS). The asteroid passed within 0.026 AU (approximately one mean lunar
distance) on April 29 2018, representing the best Earth-based apparition
until April 2118.

In anticipation of the radar observations scheduled at both the Goldstone
and Arecibo facilities, we obtained one night of time-resolved photometry
at the JPL Table Mountain Observatory (TMO) 1.0-m telescope as summarized
in Table 1.  The measured colors (B-R=1.318+/-0.021 mag; V-R=0.450+/-0.020
mag; R-I=0.343+/-0.017 mag) were found to be compatible with an S-type
spectral classification (Table 2 and 
<a href=""http://tmoa.jpl.nasa.gov/2013_US3_Figures.htm#Figure1"">Figure
1</a> 
). After assuming a solar phase parameter G=0.15 and correcting for observational
geometry we measured an absolute magnitude H_V=21.14+/-0.02 mag.  No clear
lightcurve signature was detected in our 2.2 hours of observation (

We report a new X-ray outburst from the low-mass X-ray binary SAX J1810.8-2609
(aka V4722 Sgr; Ubertini et al. 1998, IAUC 6838) observed with MAXI/GSC.
The enhancement was recognized from 2018 April 23 (MJD 58231), and X-ray
count rates in the 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV bands peaked on April 26 at 0.085
+/- 0.008 c/s/cm2 (~ 80 mCrab) and 0.096+/-0.008 c/s/cm2 (~ 82 mCrab),
respectively. The hardness of the energy spectrum did not vary significantly
during the outburst. The time-averaged energy spectrum on April 26-29 was
well represented by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 2.04 +/-
0.10 and a hydrogen column density nH of 0.3e22 fixed, and the 2-10 keV
luminosity was 4.7e36 (d/4.9 kpc)^2 erg/s where d is the distance to the
source (see Allen et al. 2018, ApJ, 854, 58, and references therein). No
X-ray burst was observed.

This is the second detection of the outbursts from this source with MAXI/GSC,
and the first detection was in May, 2012 (Degenaar & Wijnalds 2013, IAU
Symp. 291). Reanalysis of GSC data show that the peak count rates were
observed on May 12 (MJD 56059), and 0.298 (+0.033, -0.031) c/s/cm2 and
0.330 (+0.035, -0.034) c/s/cm2 in the 2-4 keV and 4-10 keV bands, respectively.
Finally, we note that weak (~0.01 c/s/cm2 at 4-10 keV) enhancement from
the region was also recognized on 2015 January 20-24 (MJD 57042-57046).

calibrated via 7 local comparison stars having Tycho-2 photometry.

The following magnitudes have been obtained for the nova:

B = 8.22 +/- 0.13 mag; V = 7.38 +/- 0.07 mag.

Following reports of a new transient of magnitude 6.2 in Perseus on 2018

(http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/unconf/followups/J04432130+4721280.html)
and positionally coincident with the previously known U Gem type dwarf
nova V392 Per, we obtained an optical spectrum on 2018 April 30.116 UT
(range: 396-687 nm; resolution 0.3 nm) with the 2.4 m Hiltner telescope
(+OSMOS) of the MDM Observatory on Kitt Peak. The spectrum (see the link
below) exhibits broad H&alpha; emission and overlapping Fe II emission
lines with P Cygni-type line profiles superposed on a flat continuum. 
The FWHM of H&alpha; emission is about 5200 km/s and its equivalent width
is about 11.5 nm.  The center of the blue-shifted H&alpha; absorption component
is displaced by about -2680 km/s with respect to the fitted center of the
emission component and its equivalent width is about 1.6 nm. Sharp interstellar
absorption lines of Na I D1 and D2 are present with equivalent widths of
about 0.1 nm.   Our spectrum is similar to that obtained by R. Leadbeater
on April 29.894 UT (http://www.spectro-aras.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2015).
The spectrum is reminiscent of classical novae early in their outburst
and prior to maximum light so the observed amplitude of ~10 mag might be
a lower limit.  The observational circumstances of V392 Per are becoming
difficult so continued optical photometry and spectroscopy to monitor its
evolution are strongly encouraged.  We note that the object is sun-constrained
to Swift for the next 80 days.  We thank C. M. Retter for assistance with
the observations.

We report the Fermi-LAT detection of the optical transient TCP J04432130+4721280
(V392 Per), which was discovered by Yuji Nakamura on 2018-04-29.4740 (CBET
#4515) and later identified as a Galactic nova by Wagner et al. (ATel #11588).
Using the Fermi-LAT data collected from 2018-04-30 00:00:00 to 23:25:53
UT, a strong gamma-ray source was detected at the nova position. There
is no known LAT source within 2 degrees around the nova. Assuming a simple
power law spectrum, the photon flux is F(100MeV-300GeV) = (8.9 +/- 2.9)
x 10^-7 ph/cm^2/s, with a photon index of 1.9 +/- 0.2 and TS = 40 (equivalent
to a ~6 sigma detection). We also performed a gtfindsrc analysis to find
the optimized position of the gamma-ray source, which is well consistent
with V392 Per's.  

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

We report on the optical photometric observation of MAXI J1820+070 with
the 2.4m telescope at Lijiang Gaomeigu Station of Yunnan observatories
with our Fast Optical Camera (FOC) on April 22, 2018, following the detection
of low frequency QPO in the optical band (ATEL #11510).  

Photometry observations of MAXI J1820+070 in white light were performed
with FOC on April 22 from UT 20:20 for nearly two hours to investigate
short-term variability on sub-second time scales, including the low frequency
QPO detected in the optical (ATEL #11510). A total of 200+ thousand images
were taken with a frame-time of 22.9 milliseconds in a field of view of
1.5 arcmin x 1.5 arcmin. The variation of the optical flux in the optical
counterpart of MAXI J1820+070 was calibrated via four brightest nearby
reference stars which were simultaneously detected in the field-of-view.
Our preliminary analysis shows the optical low frequency QPO was at around
0.157 +- 0.002 Hz with a FWHM of 0.030 +- 0.006 Hz during our FOC observations,
consistent with the primary of the low frequency QPO in frequency seen
in the X-ray power spectrum of the Swift XRT observation performed in the
same period of time around April 22 20:30 (UT). The average fractional
rms of the optical low frequency QPO was about (4.1 +- 0.3)%. Our observation
of the low frequency QPO is consistent with the frequency evolution of
the X-ray QPO as seen with Swift/XRT observations in the past few weeks
(see ATEL #11488, #11578). The optical low frequency QPO shown in the FOC
observation on April 22 is the highest in frequency among detections of
optical, UV or Infrared low frequency QPOs, which were in the frequency
range 0.05-0.13 Hz (Motch et al. 1983; Hynes et al. 2003; Durant et al.
2009; Veledina et al. 2015; Kalamkar et al. 2016; Pahari et al. 2017; Yu
et al. 2018 in ATEL #11510). 

We appreciate the efforts of the Swift PI Brad Cenko and the HXMT PI Shuangnan
Zhang for scheduling coordinated observations. The FOC project was initiated
in 2009 and the first light was taken on Jan 15, 2010 installed on the
1.56 m telescope in Shanghai. Results of the test runs was presented in
EWASS 2015. The FOC is a custom version of the Cambridge fast photon counting
systems equipped with an E2V CCD 97. We would like to thank Craig Mackay

ATEL #11584,"
The Five hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), operated
by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences,
has discovered a radio millisecond pulsar (MSP) coincident with the unassociated
gamma-ray source 3FGL J0318.1+0252 (Acero et al. 2015 ApJS, 218, 23), also
known as FL8Y J0318.2+0254 in the recently released Fermi Large Area Telescope
(LAT) 8-year Point Source List (FL8Y). Following the discovery of the radio
pulsar, gamma-ray pulsations were detected in 9.6 years of Fermi-LAT data
by performing a semi-blind search around the spin period from the radio
discovery, searching over the full FL8Y localization region and over a
range of spin-down rates typical for MSPs. The newly detected pulsar is
named PSR J0318+0253 based on the refined position from gamma-ray analysis.
J0318+0253 has a precise position of RA(J2000)=03:18:15.54, Dec(J2000)=+02:53:01.5,
a period of 5.19 milliseconds, a dispersion measure of 26 pc cm^-3 that
corresponds to a distance of about 1.3 kpc based on Yao et al. (2016),
and no detectable acceleration. 

Previous radio observations of 3FGL J0318.1+0252, including three different
epochs with Arecibo with a typical individual integration times of 15 minutes
in June 2013, did not detect the MSP. On 27 Feb. 2018, in a one-hour tracking
observation with the FAST ultra-wide band receiver, the radio pulses toward
3FGL J0318.1+0252 were detected with 512 MHz bandwidth centered around
560 MHz. We estimated the pulsar’s flux density to be ~100 micro-Jy,
corresponding to less than 15 micro-Jy in L-band assuming a canonical spectral
index of 2.1, making this potentially one of the faintest MSPs discovered
in the radio band. The detection and timing of gamma-ray pulsations confirms
that it is an isolated pulsar.  

 No X-ray counterpart is detected at the pulsar position. An analysis
of 3.4 ks of Swift XRT observations of the region resulted in an unabsorbed
flux upper limit in the 0.3-10 keV energy range of 2.8e-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1,
for an assumed power-law spectrum of index 2 and an absorption column N(H)
= 8 × 10^20 cm^-2 in the direction of the MSP. Deeper multi-wavelength
follow-up observations are strongly encouraged. 

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden. FAST will be under commissioning
until it reaches the designed specifications and becomes a Chinese national
facility. This discovery is part of the pilot program for the planned Commensal
Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS—arxiv:1802.03709) and also the first
result from a collaboration between the FAST team and the Fermi-LAT Collaboration
outlined in an MoU signed by both teams.

ATEL #11583,"
As part of our young stellar object (YSO) sub-mm monthly monitoring programme,
the JCMT Transient Survey (Herczeg et al. 2017 ApJ, 849, 43; Johnstone
et al. 2018 ApJ, 854, 31), we have uncovered a steady sixteen-month decline
in the 850 micron peak brightness of YSO HOPS 358 (R.A. 05:46:07.2, Dec.
-00:13:30.9) in NGC 2068 (d=388 pc).  

Our 850 micron sub-mm continuum monitoring of this source with SCUBA2 on
the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) revealed no evidence of variability
during the first nine epochs, December 26, 2015 through November 26, 2016.
Over this time the mean peak brightness of the source within the JCMT (15""
beam) was 1.47 +/- 0.03 Jy/bm. The most recent twelve epochs show a steep
roughly linear decline in sub-mm brightness through the most recent measurement
on March 31, 2018, where the peak brightness was 1.16 +/- 0.04 Jy/bm (see
light curve and finder chart at this URL). Thus, HOPS 358 has dimmed in
the sub-mm by 25% over sixteen months. While the absolute calibration of
the JCMT is typically uncertain by about 10%, the relative calibration
of the JCMT Transient Survey between epochs is significantly better, roughly
2% (Mairs et al. 2017 ApJ, 843, 55). 

The YSO HOPS 358 (Furlan et al. 2016, ApJS, 224, 5) is classified based
on Herschel Space Observatory continuum observations as a PACS Bright Red
Source (PBRS, Stutz et al. 2013 ApJ, 767, 36). Based on this classification,
it is thought to be among the youngest and most deeply embedded YSOs in
NGC 2068.  HOPS 358 is embedded within the dense core HH25 MMS (Bontemps
et al. 1995, A&A, 297, 98) and has a KVN-measured deuterium fractionation
no higher than typical protostars (Kang et al. 2015, ApJ, 814,31). At higher
angular resolution, using the SMA, HH25 MMS breaks into three sub-mm peaks
separated by ~10"", with HOPS 358 associated with the most northern peak
SMM1 (Chen et al. 2013, ApJ, 768, 110). 

The much fainter source HOPS 316, located 6.9"" north of HOPS 358, may contaminate
the peak beam. Difference maps between the most recent epochs and the earlier
measurements show clearly that the decrease in flux is coincident with
the position of HOPS 358. 

Follow-up observations in the infrared, submm/mm, and radio are highly
encouraged.

ATEL #11576,"
The X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 has been in outburst since its discovery
on March 11 2018 (ATel #11399). Observations at various wavelengths, including
the optical counterpart ASASSN-18ey (ATel #11400), suggest that the source
is a black hole transient in the hard spectral state (e.g., ATel #11418,
#11423, #11420, #11426). NICER has been observing the source on a regular
basis. Recent NICER observations (April 16-20) reveal variability that
remains consistent with a black hole hard state, but with a continuing
power-spectral evolution toward higher frequencies. Low-frequency QPOs
were previously detected with INTEGRAL (~0.045 Hz on March 27, ATel #11488)
and Swift (~0.06 Hz on April 1, ATel #11510). NICER observations on April
16/17 reveal two harmonically related QPOs at 0.125(3) Hz and 0.238(6)
Hz. These QPOs have fractional rms amplitudes in the 0.2-12 keV band of
8+/-1% and 4+/-1%, respectively, and Q-values between 3 and 8. 

Although the frequencies of the low-frequency QPOs continue to increase,
this does not necessarily mean that a state transition is imminent. For
example, during the 2000 outburst of the black hole transient XTE J1118+480
the low-frequency QPO increased in frequency from 0.07 Hz to 0.15 Hz, without
the source ever leaving the hard state (Wood et al. 2000, ApJ, 544, L45).

Spectrally, no clear evolution has been seen in the last couple of weeks.
A NICER 0.5-10 keV spectrum obtained on April 20 can be modeled well with
an absorbed, strongly Comptonized low-temperature accretion disk component
(kT~0.28 keV, power-law index ~1.65), confirming that the source remains
in the hard state. A broad iron line is present as well at 6.7 keV (EW=140
eV). The unabsorbed (NH~1.2e21) 0.5-10 keV flux is 4.5e-8 erg/cm^2/s. 

We also obtained a distance measurement for MAXI J1820+070 from the GAIA
data archive (Brown et al. 2018; <A>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09365</A>).
The parallax of the source is listed as 0.30+/-0.10 mas, indicating a relatively
nearby black hole X-ray binary at a distance of ~3.3 (-0.8/+1.7)  kpc.
Using the flux quoted above, this distance implies a 0.5-10 keV luminosity
of 5.7e37 erg/s, which corresponds to ~6% of the Eddington luminosity for
a 8 Msun black hole. This number could be substantially higher when taking
into account the flux outside the 0.5-10 keV band. 

Finally, we note that further inspection of NICER observations taken during
the rise of the outburst between March 12 and March 16 (unabsorbed flux:
~(0.3-1.5)e-8  erg/cm^2/s), reveals strong dips in the light curves below
2 keV. While spectral analysis suggests that these dips are due to absorption
and/or obscuration (possibly ionized), their nature is not yet fully understood.
These dips were no longer seen once the source reached its current flux
plateau (after March 21). The presence of the dips could indicate that
MAXI J1820+070 is viewed at a relatively high inclination (>70 degrees).

NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space
Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities

ATEL #11577,"
We report detections of pre-discovery outbursts of SPIRITS17pc, discovered
as part of the ongoing Spitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey (SPIRITS)
using the 3.6 and 4.5 micron imaging channels ([3.6] and [4.5]) of the
Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (ATel #11575).
SPIRITS17pc was discovered in Spitzer/IRAC images taken on UT 2017 Oct.
12.8 at [4.5] = 15.02 +- 0.03 mag (Vega). The [3.6] - [4.5] color is 0.52
+- 0.05 mag. Analysis of the pre-discovery light curve, based on image
subtraction with archival reference image stacks from 2004-2008, indicates
2 additional, progressively brightening outbursts, peaking at [4.5] = 16.3
+- 0.1 mag and 15.8 +- 0.1 mag at 783 and 551 days before the discovery
outburst, respectively. 

At an RA and Dec of 12:25:44.43, +12:39:44.5, SPIRITS17pc is located 33.2
arcsec from the center of NGC 4388 (z=0.008419, d=18 Mpc, m-M=31.3 mag,
from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database; NED), a prominent member of
the Virgo Cluster and known Seyfert 2 galaxy. At the distance to the putative
host, the absolute magnitude at [4.5] is approximately -16.3 mag, in the
luminosity range typically observed for core-collapse SNe at infrared wavelengths.

There is no obvious quiescent counterpart detected in the archival Spitzer/IRAC
images used as references for subtraction, and due to bright background
emission we are unable to place any meaningful limits on the mid-IR luminosity
of the progenitor. We also examined the archival Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) imaging of the site, which has optical to near-IR coverage with WFC3
in the F336W, F438W, F814W, F110W, and F160W filters taken on 2017 June
8 as part of the program part of program GO-12185 (PI J. Greene). By registering
with a high resolution J-band image of the transient with Keck/NIRC2 taken
on 2017 Dec. 8, we determined the precise position of SPIRITS17pc in the
HST/WFC3 F110W frame to astrometric rms uncertainty of 0.15 WFC3 pixels
(0.02 arcsec). We identify a point-like object consistent with the transient
position. We measured photometry for the candidate from the WFC3 data using
Dolphot (Dolphin 2000, PASP, 112, 1397) and found F336W = 25.52 +/- 0.22,
F438W = 26.23 +/- 0.38, F814W = 24.00 +/- 0.05, F110W = 21.57 +/- 0.03,
and F160W = 20.34 +/- 0.02 mag (Vega). Initial modelling of the broadband
spectral energy distribution with DUSTY (Ivezic, Nenkova & Elitzur 1999)
is consistent with a luminous, hot star with log(L/Lsun) ~ 5.3, T_eff ~
20,000 K, active dust formation (dust temperature ~ 1800 K), and relatively
low foreground host reddening at E(B-V) < 0.54 mag. 

Continued monitoring in the optical, infrared and radio, and analysis of
the progenitor are ongoing.

ATEL #11578,"
The X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070, discovered through its ongoing outburst
beginning on 11th March (ATEL #11399), is likely a black hole binary in
the hard state (e.g. ATEL #11418, #11423, #11420, #11426). 

Several observations have been made with NuSTAR. A low frequency QPO, often
with 2:1 and occasionally 3:1 harmonics, is detected in all observations
since the outburst peak. 

The characteristic frequency of the QPO increases exponentially with time,
as log<sub>10</sub>(f/Hz) = 0.01869*t - 2.9158 (for time in days from 2018-01-01,
MJD 58119), i.e. an e-folding time of 23 days. A plot of the QPO frequencies
can be found at the link below. 

Low frequency QPOs have also been detected with INTEGRAL (ATEL #11488),
Swift (ATEL #11510) and NICER (ATEL #11576) at frequencies matching this
relation. The QPO seen by NuSTAR is present at all energies from 3-78 keV,
implying that the same phenomenon is responsible for all these detections.

Despite the large change in QPO frequency, the X-ray flux (as measured
by Swift/BAT) is decreasing slowly and any spectral evolution (across 0.3-78
keV, measured by NuSTAR, Swift and NICER) is minimal. 

The NuSTAR spectrum comprises a hard powerlaw and reflection spectrum (broad
iron line and Compton hump), as expected for a corona and accretion disc
around a rapidly spinning black hole. 

NuSTAR results will be presented in full in a future publication (Buisson
et al. in prep.).

We report the detection of a pre-discovery outburst of SPIRITS17qm, discovered
as part of the ongoing Spitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey (SPIRITS)
using the 3.6 and 4.5 micron imaging channels ([3.6] and [4.5]) of the
Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (ATel #11575).
SPIRITS17qm was discovered in Spitzer/IRAC images taken on UT 2017 Nov.
5 at [4.5] = 15.44 +\- 0.03 mag (Vega). The [3.6] - [4.5] color is 0.21
+\- 0.04 mag. Analysis of the pre-discovery light curve, based on image
subtraction with archival reference images from 2004, indicates a previous
infrared outburst peaking at [4.5] = 16.12 +\- 0.06 mag 1322 days before
the discovery outburst. 

At an RA and Dec of 03:33:38.85, -36:08:09.4, SPIRITS17qm is located 33.5
arcsec from the center of NGC 1365 (z=0.005457, d=18 Mpc, m-M=31.3 mag,
from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database; NED). At the distance to the
putative host, the absolute magnitude at [4.5] is approximately -15.9 mag,
in the luminosity range typically observed for core-collapse SNe at infrared
wavelengths. 

In the archival Spitzer/IRAC images used as references for subtraction,
the transient is coincident with what appears to be a distinct source blended
with a marginally resolved cluster. We also examined the archival Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) imaging of the site, which includes two epochs with
WFPC2/F606W taken on 2001 March 08 and 2001 June 09 as part of program
SNAP-8597 (PI Regan). By registering with the Spitzer/IRAC [3.6] discovery
image, we determined the position of SPIRITS17pc in the 2001 March 08 HST/WFPC2
frame to astrometric rms uncertainty of 3.0 WFPC2 pixels (0.3 arcsec).
We identify a point-like object consistent with the transient position.
The F606W magnitudes (Vega) for this object from the Hubble Legacy Archive
source catalogs are 22.45 (2001-03-08) and 20.77 (2001-06-09). At the assumed
distance to the host and correcting for Galactic extinction from NED with
A_F606W = 0.49 mag, the absolute magnitudes are -9.3 and -11.0, indicating
the source is luminous and highly variable, and thus, likely associated
with SPIRITS17qm. 

Continued monitoring in the optical, IR and radio, and analysis of the
progenitor are ongoing.

We report Swift observations of the z=1.41 QSO GAIA 18ayp (PKS 2333-415)

which was detected by GAIA in an optically flaring state on 2018-April-14.

Swift observed GAIA 18ayp on 2018 April 23 for a total of 1.4 ks. 
The QSO is clearly detected in X-rays and the UV. The X-ray position 
found using the enhanced XRT position (Goad et al. 2007, Evans et al. 2009)
is 
RA-2000 = 23 36 34.1, Dec-2000 = -41 15 21.4 with an uncertainty of 3.0"".

This position coincides with the z=1.41 blazar PKS 2333-415. The X-ray

spectrum in the observed 0.3-10 keV band can be fitted with an absorbed

power law model with the absorption column density fixed to the Galactic
value 
(1.71e20 cm^-2). The X-ray photon index is Gamma = 1.65+/-0.43. The flux

in the observed 0.3-10 keV band is (1.2+/-0.2)e-15 W m^-2. In the UVOT,

the QSO was observed in the W1 and M2 filters with 17.65+/-0.10 and 
18.27+/-0.07 mag in the Vega system, respectively (not corrected for 
Galactic extinction). In the 0.1-300 GeV gamma-ray band, the blazar is

associated to the Fermi-LAT catalog source 3FGL J2336.5-4116 
(Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23). No significant gamma-ray emission 
positionally consistent with this source was detected by the LAT 
on the time scales corresponding to the optical and X-ray observations

reported above, showing that there is no gamma-ray flaring activity 
corresponding to the multi-wavelength variability. We derive an upper 
limit on the gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV) in the time period 14-23 April
2018 
of 8.0 x 10^-8 photons cm^-2 s^-1.

The accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar Swift J1756.9-2508 has been in outburst
since 2018 April 1 (ATel #11497, #11502, #11505, #11523, #11566) and has
been subject to regular monitoring with NICER (ATel #11502). Our preliminary
results show that the source flux has been decaying since the first NICER
observation obtained on 2018 April 3 15:18 UTC. 

The most recent positive NICER detection of this source was during an observation
starting on April 11 01:16 UTC, for 5 ks. At that time, the spectrum was
well described (red. chi^2 = 1.09; 468 dof) by an absorbed power-law model
with N_H = (4.8 +/- 0.1)e22 cm^(-2) and power-law photon index Gamma=(2.3
+/- 0.1), yielding a 1-10 keV unabsorbed flux of F=(9.5+/-0.4)e-11 erg/s/cm^2.

NICERs latest observation was performed on 2018 April 25 20:16 UTC, for
a total of 1.5 ks. We found that the 1-10 keV light curve was consistent
with background levels. Applying the above model to the April 25 data,
we obtain a 95%-confidence upper limit on the 1-10 keV unabsorbed source
flux of F=1.9e-11 erg/s/cm^2. (This limit does not account for systematic
uncertainties in our background model.) Our upper limit is about 5 times
fainter than the previously detected flux. Periodicity searches also find
no evidence of pulsed X-ray emission in this observation. The lack of a
pulsed detection likely indicates that this transient source has returned
to X-ray quiescence.

ATEL #11573,"
Following our initial report (ATEL #11528), we continued to follow the
spectroscopic evolution of PNV J18040967-1803581 (CBET No. 4507), a possible
classical nova or stellar merger event.  In addition to our first spectrum
obtained on 2018 April 10.444 UT and reported on ATEL #11528, we obtained
additional optical spectra (range: 396-687 nm; resolution 0.3 nm) on 2018
April 12.466, 15.450, and 22.434 with the 2.4 m Hiltner telescope (+OSMOS)
of the MDM Observatory on Kitt Peak.  The four epochs are shown from bottom
to top in the montage at the link below.  

The most recent spectra show considerable strengthening of the emission
components of H&alpha;, H&beta;, Fe II multiplets of 27, 37, 38, 42, 46,
48, 49, 55, and 74, and Na I D1 and D2.  The spectrum is now consistent
with that of a slow Fe II-type classical nova during the early decline
phase in agreement with that reported by Joshi, Srivastava, and Banerjee
(ATEL #11570) based on a near-infrared spectrum obtained on 2018 April
14.96.  The optical emission lines still continue to exhibit P Cygni-type
line profiles.  On April 10, 15, and 22, the center of the blue-shifted
absorption component of H&alpha; is displaced by -617, -608 and -780 km/s
respectively with respect to the fitted emission component.  The FWHM of
H&alpha; emission corresponds to 774, 1500, and 1700 km/s respectively
on the same dates.  The equivalent width of the H&alpha; emission component
on April 22 was -44 nm. 

Additional optical and infrared observations of PNV J18040967-1803581 are
encouraged given the likelihood of dust formation (ATEL #11570).

ATEL #11574,"
We report optical monitoring of the black hole candidate X-ray binary MAXI
J1820+070 (e.g. ATEL #11399, #11418, #11420) using the University of Florida
Rosemary Hill Observatory 14-inch telescope. We used a DMK CCD in white
light (roughly corresponding to Gaia G-band) to obtain 17 epochs of data
with 1.1Hz cadence for several hours per epoch, beginning on 28 March 2018
UT (MJD 58205). In addition to fast variability signatures (see also ATEL
#11421, #11423, #11426, #11432, #11437, #11451, #11510), we have analyzed
a subset of the data to study the long-timescale optical behavior in the
outburst. We analyzed aperture photometry of 10-minute averages of the
1.1Hz data over several nights. We find that the optical flux initially
tracked the fading of the X-rays, as seen on long timescales by the Swift
Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), fading slowly from a magnitude of G=11.7 mag
on MJD 58205. However, the optical flux appeared to decouple from the X-ray
lightcurve over the time period MJD 58221 to 58227 (see figure attached).
During this time period, the Swift BAT 15-50 keV X-ray flux decreased smoothly
by about 10%, while the optical flux dropped sharply by about 0.35 mag
(35%) in G, followed by a sharp increase in flux/variability. This apparent
decoupling does not seem to match simple X-ray reprocessing models for
producing the dominant optical flux during the outburst. However, the reported
fast optical/IR variability (see references above) seems to indicate that
the optical flux may arise in the inner regions of a jet, as seen in other
sources such as V404 Cyg (Gandhi et al., 2016; Gandhi et al., 2017; Dallilar
et al., 2017). The jet scenario would also be consistent with the decoupling
of the X-ray/optical fluxes we observe. If this is the case, the relatively
fast fading and instability in the optical flux may indicate that the jet
in MAXI J1820+070 is weakening and/or becoming unstable, while the X-ray
flux continues to slowly and smoothly fade on long timescales. 

ATEL #11539 report fading of the radio flux (which may also have a jet
origin), which seems to roughly correlate with the Swift/BAT X-ray fading.
However, in systems such as V404 Cyg in its 2015 outburst, the radio flux
was seen to probe a much larger, steadier region of the jet as compared
to the optical/IR flux arising from the inner jet (i.e. Dallilar et al.,
2017). 

The authors thank T. Maccarone for pointing out to us how very bright this
source had become, and the University of Florida for its support of the
Rosemary Hill Observatory. 

Swift/BAT data on MAXI J1820+070 were taken from the Swift/BAT transient
monitor (Krimm et al., 2013).

ZTF is currently in science validation and we are now commissioning the
ZTF alert infrastructure. The transients reported here were detected using
a preliminary version of the production pipeline with manual filtering
of the alert stream. Major components of the system are under active refinement.
This includes reliability scores from machine-learned vetting, star-galaxy
classification, and a Kafka-based alert distribution system (see http://www.ztf.caltech.edu/page/technical#status
for further details). Future ATels will report progress on the remaining
key stages of this commissioning process. Public alert distribution is
anticipated to start in late May. 

ZTF is a project led by PI S. R. Kulkarni at Caltech (see ATEL #11266),
and includes IPAC, LANL, JSI/UMd, UWM, UW (US); OKC, Sweden; DESY, Germany;
WIS, Israel, and NRC, Taiwan. ZTF acknowledges the generous support of
the NSF under AST MSIP Grant No 1440341.

ATEL #11568,"
Recent MAXI/GSC observations revealed unexpectedly rapid decay of the X-ray
flux of the black hole candidate MAXI J1535-571 discovered on 2017 September
2, MJD 57998 (ATel #10699, #10700). The source has been in the soft (thermal
dominated) state since the end of the last November, around MJD 58100 (ATel
#11020). On MJD 58120-58130, the X-ray flux increased by a factor of about
two with the spectrum unchanged, but afterward the flux continued to decrease
almost exponentially (Nakahira et al. PASJ, submitted, arXiv:1804.00800).
Recent MAXI/GSC data show that the flux decreased rapidly after MJD 58190-58200,
and that the 2-10 keV flux has been below the detection limit of GSC for
4days (about 8 mCrab) since April 16, MJD 58224, when the flux was lower
than the extrapolation of the exponential decay by one order of magnitude.
The spectrum tended to soften with the decrease, and no soft-to-hard transition
was recognized.

From previous outburst study of X-ray novae, the soft-to-hard transition
is known to occur at 1-4% of the Eddington luminosity (Maccarone 2003,
A&A, 409, 697), and such a transition was expected to occur until the end
of March even if  
the observed peak flux corresponded to the Eddington luminosity. Rapid
decrease at the end of an outburst after the soft-to-hard transition was
often observed. This time, however, the source faded away remaining in
the soft state, suggesting that for instance the disk evaporation triggering
the hard state (e.g., Meyer et al. 2000, A&A, 361, 175) did not work even
in low mass accretion rates.

We encourage multi-wavelength observations to understand what happens and
know the current status of the accretion disk of the rare bright black
hole X-ray nova.

The Swift/BAT transient monitor confirms the current outburst from the
Be/X-ray binary pulsar, H 1417-624 ( = 2S 1417-624) (Nakajima et al., ATel
#11479).  In the BAT 15-50 keV energy band, the outburst began approximately
on 20 March 2018 (MJD 57467) and the count rate has been steadily rising
since that time.  On 23 April 2016 (MJD 58232), the count rate was 0.079
+/-   0.011 ct s-1 cm-2 (15-50 keV), or about 350 mCrab.   This is already
brighter in Swift/BAT than the giant X-ray outburst of November 2009 (Krimm
et al., ATel #2276), when it peaked at around 300 mCrab.

We report near-infrared IJHKs photometric and spectroscopic (0.85 to 2.35
micron region, R ~ 1000) observations of nova PNV J18040967-1803581. Observations
were made on UT 2018 April 14.96 using the Near IR camera/spectrograph
(NICS) deployed on the 1.2m Mount Abu observatory telescope. Our spectrum
distinctly shows various Hydrogen lines of Balmer and Paschen series, O
I lines e.g. 1.1287, 1.3164 micron and N I e.g. 1.2461/1.2469 micron. He
I 1.0830 micron is present but weak in strength. Emission lines are showing
extremely weak P Cyg profile unlike previous optical spectrum(ATel #11528).
Presence of strong neutral Carbon lines e.g. 1.0693, 1.1330, 1.6005, 1.6890,
1.9722, 2.1023, 2.2906 micron clearly confirms that the nova is of FeII
class (Banerjee and Ashok, 2012, BASI, 40, 243). FWHM of Paschen Beta emission
line corresponds to ~1500 km/s.  

We have also clearly detected several low excitation lines of Na I e.g.
2.2056, 2.2084 micron and Mg I 1.504, 1.7109 micron in emission. These
lines form from elements of low ionization potential (~5 to 7 eV) relative
to that of H, O or N (~13 to 14 eV) and are good indicators of potential
dust formation as they imply the presence of a cool zone (Das et al., 2008,
MNRAS, 391, 1874). Dust has always formed in a nova when these lines were
seen in its NIR spectrum. We, thus, expect Nova PNV J18040967-1803581 to
form dust. NIR photometry gives following magnitudes: J = 5.81+-0.15, H=5.12+-0.15
and Ks=4.61+-0.2.

Optical and IR spectra from 0.47-2.5 microns (resolution: 5-30 angstroms)
of Nova Canis Majoris (CBET 4499), were obtained 2018 April 21.14 (UT)
with the Aerospace Corporation's 1.0 m telescope  using its Visible and
Infrared Imaging Spectrograph (VNIRIS). Although weak, Fe II lines are
present confirming the classification of Nova CMa 2018 by Strader et al.
(CBET 4499) as an Fe II nova.  Other low excitation features include C
I, N I, O I, Na I, and Ca II.  The forbidden lines of [O I] lines at 0.6300,
0.6363 microns are detected as well as the [N I] line at 1.040 microns.
In addition to the stronger H I lines,  P-Cygni profiles are seen on the
C I and O I lines as well.  The first overtone of carbon monoxide is strongly
in emission indicating that dust formation could soon take place.

Following the reports of a new outburst of the accreting millisecond X-ray
pulsar Swift J1756.9-2508 (ATel #11497, #11502, #11505, #11523), we performed
ToO observations of this source with Astrosat for 21.4 ks on April 10,
2018 between 14:27:48 UTC and 15:41:39 UTC. We here report the detection
of this latest outburst of this source simultaneously with Astrosat LAXPC
and SXT providing a broadband coverage. A source is detected significantly
using both LAXPC and SXT over a wideband range of 0.7-25 keV. The position
was consistent with that reported by NICER and INTEGRAL. We fitted the
combined spectrum with an absorbed multi-colored blackbody and a powerlaw
(tbabs*(diskbb+powerlaw) in Xspec).  We performed a joint fit using LAXPC
and SXT, and the neutral hydrogen column density, the disk temperature
and the powerlaw index were tied for the spectral fit of the two instruments.
We found the neutral hydrogen column density to be 4.29(8)E22 cm^(-2) which
is slightly lower than the value obtained from the NICER observation. The
value of the inner disk temperature and the powerlaw index were obtained
to be 1.71(+/-0.02) keV and 2.31(+/-0.08) respectively. For the SXT spectrum,
the powerlaw component was not needed and hence the normalization was kept
frozen to zero. The total 1-25 keV unabsorbed flux is 7.47E-10 erg/s/cm^(-2).
No evidence of any broad spectral line was present in the data (Patruno
et al 2010). The power spectra constructed from the high time resolution
LAXPC data were searched and no detection of any significant presence of
the accretion powered millisecond pulsations as reported in ATel #11502
could be obtained in the preliminary analysis. Further multi-wavelength
observations of this recent outburst of the source are encouraged. We are
grateful to the Astrosat team for the rapid scheduling of this ToO observation.

The symbiotic system AG Dra regularly undergoes quiescent and active stages
which consist of several outbursts repeating at about 360d interval (Galis
et al. 2017, OEJV 180, 24). After seven years of flat quiescence following
the 2006-08 major outbursts, in the late spring of 2015, AG Dra began rising
again in brightness toward what appeared to be a new minor outburst (ATel
#7582). The recent outburst activity of AG Dra was definitely confirmed
by the outbursts in April 2016 and May 2017 (ATel #8975; ATel #10390).
The maximal magnitudes (10.7, 9.9 and 10.7 in B filter) rank all these
brightenings to the minor outbursts of symbiotic binary AG Dra. Such photometric
behavior of the active stage is very unusual. More often, the activity
of AG Dra starts with a major outburst, during which the brightness can
reach the 8.8 and 8.4 mag in B and V band, respectively. Recent outburst
activity resembles the weak activity stage 1963-66 (Hric et al. 2014, MNRAS
443, 1103). 

UV and X-ray observations showed that there are two types of outbursts:
cool and hot ones (Gonzalez-Riestra et al. 1999, A&A 347, 478). Leedjarv
et al. (2016, MNRAS 456, 2558) demonstrated that the outbursts of AG Dra
can be clearly distinguished also according to the behavior of the prominent
emission lines in optical spectra. High-dispersion spectroscopy confirmed
significant increase of equivalent widths (EWs) of the emission lines Hbeta,
He II (4686), Halpha, He I (6678), and Raman-scattered O VI (6825) during
all three recent outbursts of AG Dra. At the same times, the blue-wing
absorption component observed in the profiles of the emission lines He
I (6678), H alpha and H beta completely disappeared and HeII/Hbeta flux
ratio was higher than 1. Such spectroscopic behavior is typical for the
hot outbursts of AG Dra (Munari et a. 2009, PASP 121, 1070; Leedjarv et
al. 2016, MNRAS 456, 2558). Here, we report about the onset of a new outburst,
the fourth one during the present active stage of AG Dra. 

After sharp and short-lasting hot outburst in May 2017 during which magnitudes
of AG Dra reached U=10.29, B=10.723, V=9.528, Rc=8.728, and I=8.148 on
May 16, 2017 (JD 2457890.439; ATel #10390), the symbiotic binary returned
to brightness typical for its quiescence stages (April 2, 2018, JD 2458211.360;
U=11.07, B=11.01, V=9.68, Rc=8.80, Ic=8.15, +/- 0.05 in U,  0.03 in B and
0.02 in VRI). Since then, AG Dra has begun a rise in brightness, reaching
U=10.82, B=10.95, V=9.67, Rc=8.77, and I=8.13 on April 14, 2018 (JD 2458223.300)
and B=10.57, V=9.45, on April 20, 2018 (JD 2458229.329). 

As part of ARAS spectroscopic monitoring (link to database below), a mid-resolution
spectrum of AG Dra (resolving power 13000, range 4000-7950 Ang) has been
obtained with the 31cm telescope on Mill Ridge Observatory, Canada on February
26, 2018 (JD 2458175.883). The ratio HeII/Hbeta was 0.67, EWs were 18.91,
28.11, 97.19, 2.03 and 7.37 Ang for He II (4686), Hbeta, Halpha, He I (6678)
and O VI (6825), respectively. For reference, values typical for quiescence
of AG Dra are HeII/Hbeta = 0.70, EWs He II 16.5, Hbeta 22.2, Halpha 81.0,
He I 1.5 and O VI 6.3 Ang. Low-resolution spectra of AG Dra obtained on
April 15, 2018 (JD 2458223.734) and April 18, 2018 (JD 2458227.388) suggested
an increase in the ratio of He II/Hbeta. A mid-resolution Echelle spectrum
of AG Dra (resolving power 11000, range 4200-7400 Ang) has been obtained
on April 20, 2018 (JD 2458229.363) with the 35cm telescope with eShel spectrograph
in Rouen, France. The values of the HeII/Hbeta ratio (1.16), as well as
EWs of prominent emission lines (He II 37.21, Hbeta 32.20, Halpha 87.97,
He I 1.94, O VI 8.72 Ang), confirm that the fourth hot outburst in the
present active stage of symbiotic binary AG Dra is in onset.

We report optical spectroscopic confirmation of the recent M81 nova candidate
M81N 2018-04b (AT2018asx = XMr5ZX = PNV J09555269+6858409), the object
was first announced and designated AT2018asx by Z. Xu and X. Gao (see <a
href=""https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018asx/"">TNS</a>), and independently
discovered by  K. Hornoch et al. in ATel #11527.  

We obtained a spectrum on 2018 April 13.864 UT using the Russian BTA telescope
equipped with the SCORPIO spectrograph. The spectrum was taken with a resolution
of 13 &Aring; in the 3670 - 7720 &Aring; range. The candidate shows strong
and broad Balmer absorption lines together with many Fe II absorption lines,
as well as Mg II, Na I, Si II, Al II. The H&beta; and H&alpha; lines show
weak emission components in a P-Cygni profile. The radial velocities in
these lines correspond to the M81 galaxy. The blue edge in the absorption
lines (H&delta;, H&gamma;, H&beta;, H&alpha;) have velocities 2000 &plusmn;
100 km/s; in the blue edge of Fe II lines (4922, 5018, 5169 &Aring;) we
measure velocities of 1800 &plusmn; 100 km/s. 

We also obtained a spectrum using the SPRAT spectrograph (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9147E..8HP"">Piascik
et al. 2014</a>) on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope (LT) on 2018 Apr 17.89
UT. The spectrum had evolved to show strong H&alpha; emission, and we measure
the FWHM of the H&alpha; line to be ~1600 km/s. We also detect H&beta;
and H&gamma; emission, along with emission lines corresponding to the 5018
and 5169 &Aring; lines of the Fe II 42 multiplet.  

These spectra confirm that M81N 2018-04b is a luminous classical nova eruption
in M81 and we classify it as a member of the Fe II spectroscopic class.

We report spectroscopic observations and classifications of optical transients
using the du Pont 2.5-m telescope (+ WFCCD) at Las Campanas Observatory.
Targets were discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae
(ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014) (ATel #11391, ATel #11343, ATel #11459),
Gaia Alerts (http://gsaweb.ast.cam.ac.uk/alerts/alertsindex) and A. Rest
et al. (for 2018agk). We used SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024)
to identify the type, phase, and redshift of the SN spectra. 

"
ATEL #11552,"
In the framework of the Asiago Transient Classification Program (see, e.g.,
Tomasella et al. 2014, AN, 335, 841), we report the spectroscopic classification
of SNhunt368, and attempted the spectroscopic classification of ASASSN-18ie
in VIII Zw 260W. The candidates were discovered  
by M. Villi and Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey  (Drake et al. 2009,
ApJ, 696, 870; http://crts.caltech.edu/), and the All Sky Automated Survey
for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014).  <br/> 
The spectra have been obtained with the 1.82m Copernico Telescope of Asiago
equipped with AFOSC (gr. VPH7, range 330-730 nm; resolution 1.5 nm).

(1) The spectrum of the host galaxy core is very similar to that of SDSS
DR14, and does not reveal any SN-like feature.  
(2) The spectrum resembles that of a normal Type Ia SN at about the B-band
maximum light. The redshift is estimated through the broad SN features.
Although SNhunt368 is projected  
near NGC 4614 (z=0.016), the SN is associated to a much more distant foreground
galaxy.   <br/> 
We also targeted  AT 2018atp, discovered by Xu et al. in the host galaxy
IC 800 (z=0.00776). No source was visible in the acquisition images down
to r = 20 mag. 

The classifications made use of the GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A,
488, 383) and SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) tools. Calibrated
spectra and additional  
information can be retrieved from the IAU Transient Name Server.

AGILE detected intense gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV from a source at
Galactic coordinates (l, b) = (287.08, -1.08) +/- 0.6 deg (68% stat. c.l.)
+/- 0.1 deg (syst.) (R.A., Dec. = 159.94, -59.84 deg, J2000), positionally
consistent with the Galactic Nova ASASSN-18fv, previously reported in a
gamma-ray flaring state by Fermi-LAT (ATel #11546). The Nova was detected
in a bright optical flare from March 20 (ATel #11454, #11456, #11460, #11467,
#11508). 

Integrating from 2018-04-14 00:00 UT to 2018-04-18 00:00 UT, a preliminary
multi-source maximum likelihood analysis yields a detection above 4 sigma
and a flux F(E>100 MeV) = (3.0 +/- 0.9) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1. 

This measurement was obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of the
sky in spinning mode. Multifrequency observations of the source are strongly
encouraged.

The MAGIC collaboration reports the first detection of very-high-energy
(VHE; E>100 GeV) gamma-ray emission from PGC 2402248, also known as 2WHSP
J073326.7+515354 (Chang et al. 2016, A&A, 598, A17) with coordinates R.A.:
07:33:26.7 h, Dec: +51:53:54.99 deg. The source is classified as an extreme
high-energy peaked BL Lacertae object of unknown redshift, included in
the 2WHSP catalog with a synchrotron peak located at 10^17.9 Hz.  

PGC 2402248 was observed with the MAGIC telescopes from 2018/01/23 to 2018/04/18
(MJD 58141-58226) for about 23 h. The preliminary analysis of these data
resulted in the detection of PGC 2402248 with a statistical significance
of more than 6 standard deviations. The VHE integral flux was estimated
to be (2.2 +/- 0.6)e-12 ph cm^-2 s-1 above 200 GeV, corresponding to around
1% of the Crab Nebula flux above the same energy threshold.   

The source was also observed with the XRT instrument on-board the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory from 2018/01/26 to 2018/04/08 (MJD 58144-58216)
with 7 visits almost contemporaneous to the MAGIC observations. The preliminary
analysis performed with the publicly available tools (http://www.swift.ac.uk/results/index.php)
shows a hint of flux variability from a minimum count rate of 0.43 (MJD
58164) to a maximum of 0.62 cnt/s during the last observation (MJD 58216),
in the 0.3-10 keV range.  

MAGIC and Swift/XRT observations of PGC 2402248 will continue during the
next days and multiwavelength observations are encouraged. The MAGIC contact
persons for these observations are R. Mirzoyan (Razmik.Mirzoyan@mpp.mpg.de),
L. Foffano (luca.foffano@phd.unipd.it) and J. Becerra Gonzalez (jbecerra@iac.es).

MAGIC is a system of two 17m-diameter Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
located on the Canary island of La Palma, Spain, and designed to perform
gamma-ray astronomy in the energy range from 50 GeV to greater than 50
TeV.  

We would like to thank the Swift Team for making these observations possible.

The preliminary analysis of MAGIC data (1h) taken during the night between
2018/04/17 and 2018/04/18 (MJD 58225-58226) yields a detection with a statistical
significance of more than 9 standard deviations, and indicates an integral
flux of (1.2 +/- 0.2)e-10 cm^-2 s-1 above 100 GeV. The estimated flux corresponds
to 25% of the Crab Nebula integral flux above the same energy threshold
(100 GeV). 

3C 279 is a FSRQ located at redshift 0.5362 (Marziani et al. 1996, ApJS,
104, 37) which was first detected as a VHE emitter in 2006 (MAGIC collaboration
et al. 2008, Science, 320, 1752). The source was reported in high state

by Fermi-LAT on April 17 (ATel #11542), a factor of almost 25 times greater
than the average value reported in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL, Acero
F., et al., 2015, ApJS, 218, 23). 

MAGIC observations on 3C 279 will continue during the next days and multiwavelength
observations are encouraged. The MAGIC contact persons for these observations
are R. Mirzoyan (Razmik.Mirzoyan@mpp.mpg.de) , J. Becerra (jbecerra@iac.es)
and V. Fallah Ramazani (vafara@utu.fi). 

MAGIC is a system of two 17m-diameter Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes
located at the Canary island of La Palma, Spain, and designed to perform
gamma-ray astronomy in the energy range from 50 GeV to greater than 50
TeV.

ATEL #11546,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed bright gamma-ray emission from a source positionally
consistent with the bright optical nova ASASSN-18fv (ATel #11454, #11456,
#11460, #11467, #11508). Preliminary analysis indicates that over the past
five days, the source was detected with 1-day (E >100 MeV) fluxes of 2
x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (photon index fixed at 2.2), and a peak of (3.6
+/- 0.3) x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainties only) on
April 14. Six HE photons (E >10 GeV) are positionally consistent with the
source, with the highest-energy photon at 37 GeV. 

We encourage multiwavelength observations. Because Fermi normally operates
in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring of this source
will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source,
we encourage multi-wavelength observations. For this source the Fermi LAT
contact people are P. Jean (pjean at irap.omp.eu) and C.C. Cheung (Teddy.Cheung
at nrl.navy.mil). 

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

ATEL #11547,"
In ATels #11331 and # 11335, we reported the NIR detection of the radio
source GB60713+5738 and the suggestion of it being in flaring state and
in association with the gamma-ray source Fermi J0713+5739. On March 9th,
2018 (MJD2458186.6696 we found the source with flux values corresponding
to J = 14.966 +/- 0.05, H = 13.926 +/- 0.06 and Ks = 13.365 +/- 0.06, while
on MJD2458140.8593 the source luminosity corresponded to J = 16.448 +/-
0.07, H = 15.865 +/- 0.02 and Ks = 14.931 + /- 0.05. 
Hence, the source has brightened by a factor of 8 in this rather short
lapse, this implies that it is undergoing a new major NIR flare.  Our observations
are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory
operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics
(Mexico), equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera. We encourage
further multi wavelength coverage.

ATEL #11538,"
Since 2015 August, the nearby TeV-detected HBL source 1ES 1959+650 (z=0.048)
is showing a  phase of considerably  enhanced X-ray flaring activity compared
to the previous years (Kapanadze et al. ""A recent strong X-ray flaring
activity of 1ES 1959+650 with possibly less efficient stochastic acceleration"",
MNRAS, 461, L26; Kapanadze et al. 2017, ""The second strong X-ray flare
in 1ES 1959+650"", MNRAS, 473, 2542; ATel #9949, # 9694, #9205, # 9121,
#8468, # 8342, # 8289, #8014, #10439, #10622). Note the flares detected
in this epoch are revealed  mostly by means of our Target of Opportunity
(ToO)  observations with X-Ray Telescope (XRT) onboard Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory.  The last Swift-XRT observation of 1ES 1959+650 was performed
on 2017 April 15 which revealed the source in a strong flaring state: the
0.3-10 count rate showed an increase by 8% between two different segments
of ObsID 00094153001 (separated by 0.8 day from each other). It reached
the value of 20.5+/-0.17 cts/s which is by a factor of 2 higher than the
weighted mean rate from all XRT observations of our target during 2005--2018.
Currently, 1ES 1959+650 is the second brightest blazar in the 0.3-10 KeV
energy range (after Mrk 421; see https://www.swift.psu.edu/monitoring/source.php?source=1ES1959+650).
In the framework of one-zone SSC models, a flaring activity of  1ES 1959+650
is also expected in the UV-radio and gamma-ray parts of the spectrum, and
intensive multiwavelength observations of 1ES 1959+650 are strongly encouraged
to study instable processes and emission mechanisms in this source. 

XRT is one of the Swift instruments along with Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
and UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT). It is a JET-X Wolter I type telescope,
developed jointly by Pennsylvania State University, Brera Astronomical
Observatory (OAB) and University of Leicester. Thanks to the unique characteristics,
good photon statistics and low background counts of this instrument (in
combination with EEV CCD2 detector), we can investigate a flux variability
on different time-scales from minutes to years, obtain high-quality spectra
for the majority of the observations, derive different spectral parameters,
and study their timing behaviour in the 0.3-10 keV range of the electromagnetic
spectrum. The Swift Satellite is operated by Pennsylvania State University.

is RA: 18:20:21.9, Dec = +07:11:07.2. It is unresolved by the VLITE beam

&plusmn; 5.3 mJy using the <A href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJS..230....7P"">
Perley & Butler (2017) </A> flux scale; the uncertainty combines the image
noise of 1.9 mJy and an assumed 15% flux scale uncertainty. 

The meter-wavelength detection complements the higher-frequency radio detections
(ATel #11533, #11439), and better constrains the broad-band radio continuum
spectrum of this black hole candidate low-mass X-ray binary. 

VLITE will continue to observe in tandem with any higher-frequency observations,
and any additional measurements will be reported.

ATEL #11542,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed an intense and hard gamma-ray flare from
a source positionally consistent with the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C
279, also known as 3FGL J1256.1-0547 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23),
with radio coordinates R.A.: 12h56m11.1665s, Dec: -05d47m21.523s (J2000.0;
Johnston et al. 1995, AJ, 110, 880). This blazar has a redshift of z=0.5362
(Marziani et al. 1996, ApJS, 104, 37). It is one of only seven FSRQs known
to be VHE gamma-ray emitters. 

Preliminary analysis indicates that the source flux has been increasing
in the past few days reaching a high state on April 16 with an average
gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (10.5+/-0.3) x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1, a
factor of almost 25 greater than the average value reported in the 3FGL.
The corresponding average gamma-ray spectrum had a photon index (E>100
MeV) of 2.06+/-0.02. Seven HE photons (E>10Gev) are positionally consistent
with it. In particular, during 18:00-24:00 UTC the average flux was (12.0+/-0.7)
x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only). 

This flare represents the third time that LAT has detected a daily averaged
flux (E>100MeV) higher than 1 x 10^-5 photons cm^-2 s^-1 from this blazar
with previous flares during June 2015 (ATel #7633) and Jan 2018 (ATel#11189).
This source is one of the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently a preliminary
estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi LAT is publicly
available (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/source/3C_279).

Because Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray
monitoring of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing
activity of this source, we encourage multi-wavelength observations. For
this source the Fermi LAT contact people are Greg Madejski (madejski@slac.stanford.edu)
and Masaaki Hayashida (masaaki.hayashida@hepburn.s.chiba-u.ac.jp). 

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

We have monitored the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 (ASASSN-18ey)
(ATel #11399) with the RATAN-600 radio telescope at 4.7, 8.2 and 11.2 GHz
during period MJD 58195-58225 (ATel #11439).  The most reliable daily light
curve was measured at 4.7 GHz, and it showed the slow decline from 62 to
52 mJy (errors ~5%) for 30 days without strong short-term variability.
The mean spectral index during last ten days is equal to +0.16 (4.7-11.2
GHz) and it can be compared with radio to mid-IR spectral index +0.33,
measured Russell et al., (ATel #11533). The very slow decay of the flaring
radio flux is not typical for microquasars such as GRS1915+105 or Cyg X-3,
rather it reminds a persistent light curve of Cyg X-1 (ATel #10459) although
MAXI J1820+070 stays yet in a flare in X-rays and optical bands.    
The RATAN-600 observations of the source are on-going.

the 2.4 m telescope (LJT + YFOSC) at Lijiang Observatory of Yunnan Observatories

before the maximum light. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova
spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry
2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 2004fu at t = -4 days
from the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift of 0.08 for its
host galaxy 2MASX J13463567+2906462, an expansion velocity of about 13,000
km/s can be derived from the absorption minimum of Si II 635.5 nm. The

ATEL #11533,"		Black Hole, Transient

MAXI J1820+070 (ASASSN-18ey) is a black hole candidate X-ray binary (e.g.
ATel #11399, #11418, #11420). It is currently in a bright, hard spectral
state (ATel #11423, #11427, #11439). Here, we report photometric mid-IR
(5-12 &mu;m) observations of the source with the VLT Imager and Spectrometer
for the mid-InfraRed (VISIR; Lagage et al. 2004, The Messenger, 117, 12</a>)
mounted on UT3 of ESO's Very Large Telescope. The observations were made
on 2018 April 8 (07:21-08:08 UTC) and April 9 (08:54-09:41 UTC) in clear
conditions (MJD 58216-7). We also report on contemporaneous radio and optical
data. MAXI J1820+070 is clearly detected (S/N > 200) in all four mid-IR
filters. The following preliminary observed flux densities (F_&nu;) were
calculated using observations of standard stars taken on the same nights:

Filter - Wavelength(&mu;m) - F_&nu;(mJy; Apr 8) - F_&nu;(mJy; Apr 9) 

B11.7 - 11.52 - 376 - 378 

B10.7 - 10.65 - 353 - 368 

J8.9 - 8.72 - 303 - 297 

M-band - 4.85 - 292 - 271 

Photometric errors are small but systematic errors are up to ~5-15% due
to the limited number of available standard stars. These mid-IR flux densities
are amongst the brightest reported in a transient low-mass X-ray binary.

The Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA) observed MAXI J1820+070
(ATel #11420) on 2018 April 8 (06:43-10:46 UTC) at 15.5 GHz. We reduced
the data using the reduce_dc pipeline. We then performed cleaning (with
natural weighting) and additional flagging in CASA. Using IMFIT in CASA,
we measured a flux density of the unresolved point source of 42 +- 2 mJy.

The <a href=""http://alsadeemastronomy.ae/"">Al Sadeem Observatory</a> (Owner/Co-founder
Thabet Al Qaissieh, Director/Co-founder Alejandro Palado, Resident Astronomer
Aldrin B. Gabuya) is located in Al Wathba South, outside the city of Abu
Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. We observed MAXI J1820+070 on 2018 April
7 (22:21-22:34 UTC) with the Meade LX850 16-inch (41-cm) telescope with
an SBIG STT-8300 camera. 20 images (each 30 sec.) were taken in the 'green'
Baader LRGB CCD-Filter (similar bandpass to Johnson V-band). The images
were bias/dark-subtracted and flat fielded. We measured a brightness of
V = 12.05 +- 0.04 mag, calibrated using several APASS stars in the field.
From our Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) optical monitoring (ATel #11418)
we measure magnitudes (using PanStarrs calibration) of g' = 12.09 +- 0.02,
r' = 12.14 +- 0.03, i' = 12.09 +- 0.04, y = 12.08 +- 0.16 on 2018 April
8 (~7 UTC).  

We de-reddened the above flux densities using an extinction of E(B-V)=0.163
(ATel #11418), and constructed the broadband, radio to optical spectral
energy distribution (SED; figure linked below). For comparison, we also
include a radio, near-IR and optical SED from 2018 March 18 (data from
ATel #11439, #11458 and LCO). The mid-IR fluxes clearly represent an excess
over the optical emission, and appear to lie close to the extrapolation
of the near-IR excess previously reported in ATel #11458. The SED is similar
to those of GX 339-4 (Gandhi et al. 2011, ApJ, 740, L13</a>) and MAXI J1836-194
(Russell et al. 2014, MNRAS, 439, 1390) in which the IR was shown to be
produced by synchrotron emission from the jet. The SED shape suggests that
the jet break between optically thin and partially self-absorbed synchrotron
may reside within the mid-IR to far-IR range. Assuming a simple power law,
the radio to mid-IR spectral index is &alpha; ~ +0.3 (where F_&nu; &prop;
&nu;^&alpha;). By fitting the April 8 VISIR data and y-band point, we obtain
&alpha; ~ -0.7. 

We encourage coordinated observations during the outburst decay to track
the evolution of this spectrum. The LCO observations are part of an on-going
<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/faulkesxrb"">monitoring campaign</a> of ~ 40
low-mass X-ray binaries (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2751"">Lewis
et al. 2008</a>) with LCO and the Faulkes Telescopes.

We have serendipitously obtained V, R, and I -band imaging data of the
host galaxy NGC 4151 of SN 2018aoq using the Hiroshima Optical and Near-InfraRed
camera (HONIR; Akitaya et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE 9147, 91474) installed to
the Cassegrain focus of the 1.5-m Kanata telescope at the Higashi-Hiroshima
Observatory on Mar 31.5. The observations were performed at 0.5 days prior
to the pre-discovery detection reported by Nazarov et al. (ATEL #11498).
We confirmed the non-detection of the supernova 
in our images, and gave the upper-limit magnitudes of 17.7, 17.5, and 17.3
mag in V, R, and I -bands, respectively. Their upper-limit magnitudes were
estimated using the reference star magnitudes in the 
APASS (Henden et al. 2016) catalog. It indicates that the light curves
exhibit the quickly rising at 
that time. Follow-up observations for this supernova should be encouraged.

ATEL #11528,"
Recently, T. Kojima and H. Nishimura independently discovered a new optical
transient on 2018 April 8.72 - 8.73 UT in Sagittarius with a magnitude
of about 11.2. The object was subsequently designated PNV J18040967-1803581
on the CBAT Transient Object Confirmation Page (TOCP; http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/unconf/followups/J18040967-1803581.html).
On 2018 April 9.4477 UT the transient was observed by G. Masa and M. Schwartz
using the 0.4 m robotic telescope of Tenagra Observatories where the source
had R = 9.5 mag. A low resolution (~400) spectrum was obtained by H. Akazawa
using a 0.35 m telescope on 2018 April 09.827 UT and showed a H&alpha;
emission line with a P-Cyg type line profile.  Measurements of the spectrum
by K. Ayani and reported on the TOCP showed that the bottom of the blue-shifted
absorption line was displaced by about -1100 km/s with respect to the emission
peak. 

We obtained a spectrum (range: 394-687 nm; resolution 0.3 nm) of PNV J18040967-1803581
on 2018 April 10.444 UT with the 2.4 m Hiltner telescope (+OSMOS) of the
MDM Observatory on Kitt Peak.  The spectrum exhibits emission lines with
sharp P Cyg type line profiles superposed on a very red continuum.  In
agreement with Akazawa and Ayani, the strongest emission line in our spectrum
arises from H&alpha;.  A simple two-Gaussian deconvolution of the line
profile gives a FHWM for the emission component of 774 km/s and an equivalent
width of -0.37 nm.  The FWHM corresponds to an average expansion velocity
of 387 km/s.  The absorption component is narrow but quite deep with an
equivalent width of 0.98 nm and a FWHM of 632 km/s.  In our spectrum, the
bottom of the blue-shifted absorption component is displaced by -617 km/s
relative to the fitted emission peak. The terminal velocity is about 1400
km/s.  The rest of the spectrum is dominated by very weak emission lines
with sharp P Cyg type line profiles of H&beta;, H&gamma;, H&delta;, and
numerous Fe II lines arising from multiplets 27, 37, 38, 42, 48, 49, 55,
and 74.  No broad absorption lines arising from a late-type secondary star
are apparent in our spectrum at this time.  The interstellar Na I D1 and
D2 lines are strong with equivalent widths of 0.092 and 0.120 nm respectively,
and when combined with the red continuum, suggests that the interstellar
absorption is high along the line of sight. 

Our spectrum does not appear to resemble that of a Fe II classical nova
early in the outburst. However, if the possible progenitor from Pan-STARRS
DR1 reported by P. Schmeer on the TOCP is related to the transient, then
the outburst amplitude is about 12 mag and is comparable to some classical
novae.  However, the low expansion velocities and the numerous sharp absorption
lines suggest that this object may be related to the class of luminous
red novae such as V4332 Sgr and V838 Mon.  Additional photometry and spectroscopy
over the next few weeks may well reveal the nature of PNV J18040967-1803581
so continued observations are encouraged.

Following the discovery of a new outburst from the accreting millisecond
X-ray pulsar SWIFT J1756.9-2508 (ATel #11497, #11502, #11505), a dedicated
target of opportunity observation with INTEGRAL was carried out from 2018
April 1 at 08:30 to 23:15 (UTC; total exposure time 85 ks).  

The source was detected in the 20-40 keV IBIS/ISGRI mosaic at a significance
level of 20 sigma. The estimated flux from the 20-40 keV mosaic is 15.3+/-0.8
mCrab (roughly 1.2E-10 erg/cm^2/s). The ISGRI spectrum of the source (effective
exposure time 51.6 ks) could be well described by using a power-law with
a photon index of 1.8 +/- 0.2. The 20-100 keV flux measured from the fit
is 2.8E-10 erg/cm^2/s.  

The source was also detected by JEM-X at a significance of about 8 sigma
in the 3-20 keV mosaic. From this mosaic, we estimated a 3-20 keV flux
of 14+/-2 mCrab (roughly 3E-10 erg/cm^2/s). No evidence of Type-I X-Ray
bursts were found in the JEM-X data.  

We are grateful to the INTEGRAL planning team for the rapid scheduling
of the observation of SWIFT J1756.9-2508.

We obtained an optical spectrum (range 350-900 nm) of SN 2018aql, discovered
by the Tsinghua-NAOC Transient Survey (TNTS), on UT Apr. 09.85 2018 with
the 2.4-m telescope (+YFOSC) at LiJiang Observatory of Yunnan Observatories
(YNAO). The spectrum is consistent with a type IIP supernova at a few days
before the maximum light, showing a blue continuum and prominent P-Cygni
features of Balmer lines. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova
spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry

days from the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift of 0.074 for
its host galaxy (via SNID), an expansion velocity of about 12,000 km/s
can be derived from the absorption minimum of Ha line. The classification

ATEL #11517,"
Swift J0243.6+6124 is a Be/X-ray transient that was discovered in October
2017 when it started a giant, type-II outburst (Atel #10809, Atel #10822).
After reaching the peak around November 5<sup>th</sup> 2017, the source
luminosity started to decay slowly over &sim;135 days, although the decay
rate increased significantly around two weeks ago. 

To investigate how exactly the source would decay and potentially transit
back into quiescence, we triggered a monitoring program (PI: Degenaar)
on the system using the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory (Swift). During
the observations the count rate, as observed using the X-ray telescope
(XRT), decreased from 2.35&plusmn;0.11 counts/s on March 22<sup>nd</sup>
2018 to 0.60&plusmn;0.03 counts/s on April 1<sup>st</sup> 2018. In this
observation, when the source had the lowest observed XRT count rate (April
1<sup>st</sup> 2018), the Swift/XRT spectrum is well fitted by a power-law
model (nH=1.6&plusmn;0.3e22 cm<sup>-2</sup> and &Gamma;=0.85&plusmn;0.15),
which gives a 0.5-10.0 keV unabsorbed X-ray flux of 5.75&plusmn;0.29e-11
erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>. The corresponding X-ray luminosity (L<sub>X</sub>)
is 4.30&plusmn;0.22e34 erg/s if we assume a distance to the source of 2.5
kpc (Atel #10968) or L<sub>X</sub>=1.72&plusmn;0.09e35 erg/s if the source
is placed at a distance of 5 kpc (Doroshenko et al. 2017, A&A in press,
<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv171010912D"">arXiv:1710.10912</a>).

After our XRT observations on April 1<sup>st</sup> 2018, the source suddenly
increased in count rate during the following observation to 5.49&plusmn;0.29
count/s on April 6<sup>th</sup> 2018. A similar increase in brightness
can be seen from the Swift/BAT light curve of the source available at <a
href=""https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/weak/SwiftJ0243.6p6124/"">swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/weak/SwiftJ0243.6p6124/</a>.
Since the PC mode data are strongly affected by pile-up, we only extracted
the spectrum from the data obtained using the WT mode (&sim;569 seconds
of data). A power-law fit to the spectrum obtained on April 6<sup>th</sup>
2018 resulted in a photon index of 0.35&plusmn;0.14 (nH=1.4&plusmn;0.4e22
cm<sup>-2</sup>) and a 0.5-10 keV unabsorbed X-ray flux of 2.59&plusmn;0.12e-10
erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (L<sub>X</sub>=1.94&plusmn;0.09e35 erg/s or L<sub>X</sub>=7.75&plusmn;0.36e35
erg/s assuming 2.5 kpc or 5 kpc respectively). Swift monitoring observations
of Swift J0243.6+6124 are scheduled every other day, but the system is
becoming Sun constrained by the end of April (until early June). Observations
of this source at other wavelengths are encouraged to study the nature
of the rebrightening. 

We thank the Swift team for scheduling our monitoring observations of Swift
J0243.6+6124.

IGR J17379-3747 is a neutron star low-mass X-ray binary, identified as
an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar by the detection of 468 Hz pulsations
by NICER (Atel #11507). On 19 March 2018, MAXI/GSC reported renewed X-ray
activity of this source (ATel #11447). This outburst reached a peak 2-10
keV X-ray luminosity of 9E35 (D/8 kpc)<sup>2</sup> erg s<sup>-1</sup> on
23 March 2018 (Atel #11487), after which it started to decay in X-rays.
On 4 April 2018, the source was no longer detected in a 645 second monitoring
observation using the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT).  

Here, we report the X-ray re-brightening of IGR J17379-3747 in the latest
XRT monitoring observation taken on 8 April 2018 00:59 UT. We extract the
PC-mode spectrum using the Swift XRT online pipeline (Evans et al. 2009,
MNRAS, 397, 1177) and fit it in the 0.5 to 10 keV energy range with an
absorbed power law model (TBABS*PO in XSPEC). The spectrum is well-described
with an N<sub>H</sub> = (1.05 +/- 0.17) E22 cm<sup>-2</sup>, a power law
index 2.6 +/- 0.2 and a reduced chi-squared of 222/351. The unabsorbed

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient. 

We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their
continued support of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation through grant GBMF5490 to the Ohio State University,
NSF grant AST-1515927, the Mt. Cuba Astronomical Foundation, the Center
for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP) at OSU, the Chinese Academy
of Sciences South America Center for Astronomy (CASSACA), and the Villum
Fonden (Denmark). For more information about the ASAS-SN project, see the

ATEL #11518,"
ASASSN-18gq was reported as a low-luminosity transient in the direction
of the nearby galaxy ESO325-G011 on April 03 2018 (ATel#11500). The transient
was detected as a g=16.5 source on 2018 April 1.89 and was not present
during the earlier observations of the field carried out on 2018 March
28.27 (detection limit of g~17.6). Blue UV-optical colors reported by ATel#11501
constrained the nature of the transient as broadly consistent with a young
core-collapse supernova. Furthermore the transient was observed by the
ePESSTO survey and the spectrum revealed Balmer lines in absorption at
zero redshift, contradicting the supernova classification (ATel#11509).

We observed the transient with the 2.5m NOT telescope at the ORM observatory
during the night of April 03/04 2018 at ~02:00 UT, close to transit of
the field at El~19 degrees and AM~3. Our goal is to better constrain the
nature of the transient, carrying out a search of the possible progenitor.
Astrometry of the field was carried out, utilizing the IRAF imtools.imcoords
suite. It was based on 8 individual dithered frames, using between 3 and
7 reference stars in the field, coming from the Sky Mapper Southern Sky
Survey DR 1.1. (Wolf et al. 2018, PASA, arXiv:1801.07834). We measure the
following mean position:

RA= 13:45:03.495+/-0.003 

Dec= -41:52:23.34+/-0.23 

The reported uncertainties are the statistical errors of the mean. We also
note that in general there is a 0.16 arcsec median offset between the Sky
Mapper and Gaia astrometry (Wolf et al. 2018). Our position is coinciding
within the uncertainties with the position reported by ATel#11500. A comprehensive
search in various databases and archives revealed no counterpart around
the reported position even with a generously relaxed search radius of 2
arcsec. In particular the non-detection in the Sky Mapper Southern Sky
Survey DR1.1 implies progenitor magnitudes higher than ~18 for the entire
filter system of the survey. Based on the Gaia DR1 magnitude histogram
at https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr1 we can conclude that the progenitor
should be fainter than G~24. A search in the Hubble Source Catalog (HSCv2),
revealed a single counterpart at about 1.5 arcsec from the transient position
with a W2_814W=23.5m. The reported limits set up an amplitude of the outburst
of the order of 8 magnitudes. Based on the data available, we propose the
hypothesis that ASASSN-18gq is a Luminous Red Nova outburst in the direction
of ESO325-G011. Further observations are strongly encouraged. 

Based on observations made with the Nordic Optical Telescope operated on
the island of La Palma by NOTSA in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de

One of the five satellites in BRITE-Constellation (http://www.brite-constellation.at/)
was obtaining time-series optical photometry of the star HD 92063, only
2 arcmin from the 'Possible, Very Bright Galactic Nova ASASSN-18fv' reported
on 21 March 2018 (2018-03-20.32) by ATel #11454.  The satellite BRITE-Toronto
began monitoring HD 92063 on 15 Feb 2018 (2018-02-15) and captured the
rise of light of ASASSN-18fv on 18 March 2018 (2018-03-18); its photometry
pre-dates the discovery announcement. BRITE observations of this target
are scheduled to continue until 31 July 2018 (2018-07-31). 

The light curve consists of 4-sec exposures through a custom red filter
(550-700 nm) and obtained  3 times per minute during a 15-min portion of
each 100-min orbit of the BRITE-Toronto satellite, resulting in about 600
measurements per day.  The detector scale of the instrument is about 27
arcsec/pixel and the PSF shape is round and measures about 11 pixels (FWHM)
at the field location of HD 92063. As a result, the PSFs of HD 92063 and
ASASSN-18fv significantly overlap in the BRITE-Toronto images. 

BRITE photometry reveals a discernible variation due to ASASSN-18fv starting
on 2018-03-18.2 . The light curve of the mean signal level of the blended
stars exhibits a general rise but with strong dips during both rise and
decline on timescales of days.  The highest peak in the light curve thus
far (71420 e/sec) was recorded on 2018-03-26.2. The latest flux measurement
at the time of this report (2018-04-03.2) was 62280 e/sec. Here is a list
of the measured combined (HD92063 + ASASSN-18fv) flux values averaged per
day.  It does not sample the superimposed oscillatory behavior.

BRITE-Constellation photometry is usually checked daily by R. Kuschnig
for quality and integrity by means of a fast reduction and analysis pipeline.
Photometry of HD 92063 (K1 III, V = 5.09) during the first 30 days of monitoring
was consistent with expectations for a red giant of this brightness: photometric
scatter of about 0.4% with a mean signal level of 52039  e/sec. No trends
or excursions greater than 3% were seen before the rise (up to a peak of
about +54% seen so far) associated with ASASSN-18fv.

(1) Balmer lines are detected in absorption at z = 0. The suggested association
with galaxy ESO 325- G011 (see ATels # 11500, # 11501) might be a chance
alignment. <br /> 
(2) Blue continuum. There are possibly Balmer lines in absorption at z=0
but the detection significance is low.  <br /> 
(3) Nuclear transient heavily contaminated by host light. SNID finds matches

SN2018aoz/DLT18q was discovered by the DLT40 supernova search and classified
as a young Ia (ATEL #11496).  It was observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory beginning 2018-04-03 13:56:50.  The SN has continued to brighten
in all 6 Swift/UVOT filters.  The magnitudes below are from summed images
from the latest set of observations.  These magnitudes were reduced using
the method outlined for the Swift Optical Ultraviolet Supernova Archive
(SOUSA) on the Swift/UVOT Vega-based photometric system (Poole et al. 2008,
Breeveld et al. 2011).  They have not been corrected for galaxy contamination
or dust reddening.

The UV-optical colors (including the mid and near-UV ranges) are quite
blue compared to normal type Ia supernova, most similar to those of Super-Chandrasekhar
candidates (Brown et al. 2014), SN2004dt (Wang et al. 2012), or the UV-brightest
SN Ia 2011de (Brown 2014).  These objects still have a sharp drop in flux
shortward of 3000 Angstroms; thus the characterization as ""UV-bright"" could
be more appropriately described as ""not as catastrophically UV-faint as
normal SNe Ia.""   We encourage further observations.  

These observations were triggered as part of a Swift GI program: SUPERNOVA
KEY PROJECT: SWIFT RESPONSE TO NEARBY SUPERNOVAE.  We thank the Swift team
for the scheduling of these observations.

ATEL #11510,"
We report the V-band photometric observation of MAXI J1820+070 (also named
ASASSN-18ey, see ATELs #11399, #11400, #11403, #11404, #11406, #11418,
#11420, #11421, #11423, #11424, #11425, #11426, #11432, #11437, #11439,
#11440, #11445, #11451, #11478, #11481) with the Lijiang 2.4m telescope
(+YFOSC) at Lijiang Gaomeigu Station of Yunnan observatories, in comparison
with the Swift/XRT observation of MAXI J1820+070 on the same day.  

Optical photometry observations of the source were performed on March
30th, April 1st, and April 4th. The optical observation from UT 19:53:35
to 20:19:45 on April 1st 2018 is the only observation among three with
enough exposure and short frame time to investigate variability on time
scales of seconds or longer. The exposure time of each image was set to
3 seconds, and the readout time of each image was about 3.5 second. A total
of 240 images were obtained during the observation of about 1570 seconds.
The average time resolution is then around 6.5-6.6 seconds. The variation
of the V-band optical flux of this transient was measured via 12 local
reference stars. The optical light curve shows variability as compared
with the reference stars. An average Fourier power spectrum was generated
in segments of 64 images each. We found a quasi-periodic oscillation at
around 49.53 +-0.5 mHz with a FWHM of 4.6 +- 1.9 mHz (the power spectrum
was modeled as a Lorentzian or a zero-centered Lorentzian plus a Lorentzian
- we obtained similar results). The average fractional rms is about 3.2%
with a significance of around 4.7 sigma. An investigation of the individual
power spectra suggested that the signal persisted in most of the segments.
The mHz optical QPO might be different from those reported in ATEL #11426,
due to its lower fractional amplitude and shorter period, but consistent
with the evolution of the X-ray QPO as seen with Swift/XRT observations
in the past few weeks.  

It is interesting to compare optical variability to its X-ray variability,
as suggested by ATEL #11432. There was  a Swift/XRT observation taken at
09:35:04 on April 1st, 2018 (ObsID 00010627021), which is close the our
optical observation on the same day. The XRT was used in the Windowed-Timing
mode with exposure time 932.34 seconds. We generated an average Fourier
power spectrum from the event mode data. The average X-ray power spectrum
was modeled with two zero-centered Lorentzians plus a QPO at 58.04 +- 3.97
mHz with a FWHM of 35.32 +- 15.66 mHz. The fractional rms amplitude was
around 13%. The X-ray QPO is likely the low frequency C-type QPO seen in
the rising phase of black hole transient outburst, although we still need
more data to confirm its origin with more monitoring towards possible spectral
transition. The optical QPO we found is at a frequency remarkably close
to the X-ray QPOs seen in the Swift/XRT observation within a day, and we
suspect that they are related, as inferred from the previous report of
correlated optical/X-ray variability. Black hole low frequency QPO has
been proposed as originated from the Lense-Thirring precession of the innermost
accretion flow (see Ingram, Done & Fragile 2009, 397, L101). However, the
smaller FWHM of the optical QPO as compared with that of the X-ray QPO
raises questions about whether and how the two are related. The higher
coherence of the optical QPO hints itself is not a reprocessed signal as
compared with the X-ray QPO. Simultaneous multi-wavelength timing observations
are therefore highly encouraged.  

We would like to thank the Swift team and other colleagues for providing
continuous Swift monitoring observations of MAXI J1820+070 to the public.

#11468) were observed at radio wavelengths using the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) on 2018 Apr 3.3 UT. Nova Muscae 2018 has faded by
a factor of 3 at 9.0 and 5.5 GHz since peaking at >30 mJy/bm in mid-March.
Observations are continuing in case Nova Muscae 2018 enters a second radio
peak similar to that seen in the classical nova V1324 Sco (Finzell et al.
2018, ApJ, 852:108). 

No radio emission was detected at the position of Nova Carinae 2018/ASASSN-18fv
yielding 3-sigma upper limits of 0.3 milliJy/bm at 5.5 GHz, and 0.1 milliJy/bm
at 9.0 GHz. We would like to extend our thanks to the ATCA staff for enabling
these observations. The Australia Telescope Compact Array is funded by
the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a National Facility managed

The Swift/BAT transient monitor confirms the current outburst from the
accreting millisecond pulsar, Swift J1756.9-2508 (Mereminskiy et al., ATel
#11497; Bult et al., ATel #11502).   In the BAT 15-50 keV energy band,
the outburst began on 29 March 2018 (MJD 58206) and peaked on 1 April 2018,
when the flux reached 0.013 +/- 0.002 ct s-1 cm-2 or ~60 mCrab.   The outburst
began to decline by 3 April 2018, reaching 0.005 +/- 0.003 ct s-1 cm-2
(~23 mCrab) by 5 April 2018. The peak rate and duration (assuming that
the outburst is indeed in its final decline) are comparable to the peak
rates and durations the outbursts of 2007 (Krimm et al, 2007, ApJ,688,147)
and 2009 (Patruno et al., ATel #2130).  There have been no confirmed outbursts
since 2009.

We obtained a near-infrared spectrum (range 0.8-1.7 micron, R~3500) of
the bright Galactic transient ASASSN-18fv (ATel #11454, #11456, #11460,
#11467, #11468, #11504) on UT 2018 April 1.23 with the ARCoIRIS spectrograph
mounted on the Blanco 4m telescope at Cerro Tololo in Chile. The spectrum
shows a rich set of emission lines over a relatively flat continuum. We
identify lines from H I, He I, Ca II, N I, O I, C I transitions with FWHM
velocities of a few x 100 km/s to ~2000 km/s. The spectrum does not show
any strong absorption lines or P-Cygni profiles, showing significant evolution
from the optical spectra obtained ~10 days earlier (ATel #11456, #11460,
#11468). The spectrum of ASASSN-18fv is consistent with the observed near-IR
spectra of normal Fe II and transition (Fe II + He/N) class novae after
peak (e.g., Srivastava et al. 2016, MNRAS, 462, 2074), and significantly
different from the near-IR spectra of V838 Mon (Rushton et al. 2005, MNRAS,
360, 1281) and Sakurai's object (e.g., Eyres et al. 1998, MNRAS, 298, 37;

ATEL #11507,"
Following a 2018 March 19 MAXI alert of a new outburst of the neutron star
low-mass X-ray binary IGR J17379-3747 (ATel #11447), NICER has observed
the source daily since 2018 March 29.  From that date onward, the mean
count rates detected each day through April 1 were 12.9, 11.0, 8.7, and
4.7 ct/s (0.5-12 keV), respectively. The background count rate in this
band is less than 1 ct/s. 

After applying barycenter corrections to the event times using the radio
position reported in ATel #11487, we computed a combined power spectrum
of the full ~9 ks collected exposure and detected a clear pulsation (>
7 sigma significance for a single trial) at a frequency of 468.05 Hz. The
data consist of 11 segments of varying uninterrupted exposure between 500
s and 1000 s duration. We searched these segments for pulsations individually
using the PRESTO acceleration search code. We detected a power-spectrum
excess near 468.05 Hz in seven of those segments (at a significance ranging
from 6 to 8 sigma in each segment, with frequencies ranging from 468.05
to 468.12 Hz). Fitting the observed frequency modulation with a circular
orbit model yielded an excellent fit, with an orbital period of 1.88 hrs
and a minimum companion mass of 0.055 Msun (assuming a 1.4 Msun neutron
star). The barycentric pulsar spin frequency is 468.0832 Hz. 

We extracted a 0.5-10 keV spectrum for each day, and find they are all
consistent with an absorbed power-law model. However, adding a blackbody
component significantly improves the fits (reduced Chi^2 = 0.97 for 1278
d.o.f.). The blackbody temperature decreases from 0.52+/-0.06 keV to 0.39+/-0.03
keV as the flux declines. At the same time, the power-law component softens
slightly, with the photon index evolving from 2.1+/-0.1 to 2.4+/-0.1. The
measured hydrogen column density is N_H=(0.7+/-0.1)e22 cm^-2, consistent
with a previously reported value (ATel #1714), but significantly lower
than the most recently reported value (ATel #11487). The unabsorbed flux
decreases from 7.4e-11 ergs/cm^2/s (2018 March 29) to 2.5e-11 ergs/cm^2/s
(2018 April 1).   

Our pulsation detection conclusively identifies IGR J17379-3747 as an accreting
millisecond X-ray pulsar. NICER monitoring of the source continues. Given
its rapidly declining X-ray flux, prompt follow up at other wavelengths
is encouraged.

"
ATEL #11502,"
Following the report of a new outburst of the accreting millisecond X-ray
pulsar Swift J1756.9-2508 (ATel #11497), NICER performed pointed observations
starting on 2018 April 3, collecting 9.4 ks of exposure over the ~30 hours
between April 3 15:18 UTC and April 4 21:01 UTC. A source is clearly detected
at ~30 ct/s (1-10 keV); the background level in this band is less than
1 ct/s. 

After barycenter-correcting the event times, we computed a power spectrum
and detected a >5-sigma pulsation at 182.067 Hz, confirming that the active
source is indeed Swift J1756.9-2508 (see Krimm et al. 2007, ApJ 668, L147,
and the erratum in Krimm et al. 2009, ApJ 703, L183). 

The pulsar has a known binary period of 54.7 min. Propagating the best-known
orbital solution (Patruno et al. 2010, MNRAS 403, 1426) under the assumption
of a constant binary period, we calculated a current-epoch time of ascending
node to be T_asc = MJD 58211.0170(2) TDB. The uncertainty on this predicted
reference time is less than 0.5% of the orbital period. We then optimized
our trial orbital solution by scanning a grid of T_asc values in steps
of 1E-5 d. We found the best solution at T_asc = MJD 58211.01736 TDB, consistent
with the prediction within 2 sigma (statistical uncertainty). 

Folding the data using this orbital ephemeris, we retrieved an improved
pulsation detection (22 sigma) at frequency F0=182.065803(2) Hz. The pulse
profile is non-sinusoidal, showing a fractional sinusoidal amplitude of
5.9% for the fundamental and 3.4% for the first overtone, both measured
in the 1-10 keV band. The shape of the pulse profile is similar to those
shown in Figure 1 of Patruno et al. (2010), albeit in a somewhat softer,
overlapping energy band. A more detailed analysis is underway. 

The X-ray spectrum is consistent with an absorbed disk-blackbody plus power-law
model (red. chi^2 = 1.18 for 840 d.o.f). We measured an absorption column
density of N_H = 6.4(2)E22 cm^-2, a disk temperature of kT = 0.17(1) keV,
and a power-law photon index of Gamma = 2.04(3). There is no evidence of
an Fe line feature near ~6.4 keV in the spectrum. The unabsorbed 1-10 keV
flux is 1.3e-9 erg/s/cm^2. All values are consistent with those of the
previous outbursts, and suggest that the source is in a typical atoll-type
island (hard) spectral state.  

Further NICER observations of this source are underway. Additional multiwavelength
follow-up is encouraged.

ATEL #11501,"
SN2018apl/ASASSN-18gq (ATEL #11500) was observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory beginning 2018-04-03 15:28:06.  We measured the magnitudes
below from summed images from the first orbit of observations using the
Swift Optical Ultraviolet Supernova Archive (SOUSA; Brown et al. 2014).
They have not been corrected for galaxy contamination or dust reddening.

ATEL #11497,"		Pulsar

During recent observations (1-2 Apr 2018, PI: E.Bozzo) of the weak X-ray
burster IGR J17379-3747 (#11447,#11487, Chelovekov et al. 2006, AstL, 32,
456) and regular observations of Galactic center region (2-3 Apr 2018,
PI: R.A. Sunyaev) we detected a new X-ray transient in 20-60 keV sky maps
obtained by IBIS/ISGRI. Its position is consistent with that of known accreting
millisecond pulsar SWIFT J1756.9-2508. 

In order to identify the transient we performed ToO observation with XRT
onboard The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Although the field is heavily
polluted by single scattered photons from nearby bright LMXB GX 5-1 we
clearly detected the source, with best-estimated position of (J2000) 269.23892,
-25.10790 (error is 2.5"", 90% confidence), which is 0.65"" from catalog
position of SWIFT J1756.9-2508. 

Fitting the XRT spectrum with absorbed powerlaw model we found strong absorption
NH = (7.9&plusmn;2.7)&times;10<sup>22</sup> and a moderate slope of 1.6+-0.6.
Total observed flux in 0.3-10 keV is (3.0&plusmn;0.5)&times;10<sup>-10</sup>
erg cm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and quasi-simultaneous observations of
INTEGRAL yield an (5.5&plusmn;0.3)&times;10<sup>-10</sup> erg cm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>
(44&plusmn;3 mCrab) flux estimate in 20-60 keV. 

Given the positional coincidence and strong obscuration, that is consistent
with previous observations (e.g. Krimm et al, 2007, ApJ,688,147) we proposing
that the observed transient is a new outburst of accreting millisecond
pulsar SWIFT J1756.9-2508. 

Follow-up observations are strongly encouraged. 
We are very grateful to The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory team and its
PI Brad Cenko for rapid scheduling of our observations.

We report the discovery and classification of DLT18q/AT 2018aoz.  The supernova
was found on 2018 April 02.1 (UT) at r~15.1 mag during the ongoing D<40
Mpc (DLT40) supernova search, using data from the PROMPT5 0.41m telescope
located at CTIO.  An inspection of earlier epochs shows the presence of
the supernova in our data as early as 2018 March 30.1 (UT).  An optical
spectrum from the robotic FLOYDS spectrograph at Siding Springs, Australia
was obtained on 2018 April 2.39. Spectral classification was performed
with SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), with good matches to
normal type Ia supernovae approximately two weeks before maximum light.
The velocity of the ejecta, as measured from SiII 635.5 nm, is around 14000
km/s. We encourage further observations.

ATEL #11494,"
The TeV-detected ultra-high-energy peaked BL Lacertae source  (UHBL)  1ES
0033+595 was observed 87 times with X-Ray Telescope (XRT) onboard the Neil
Geherels Swift Observatory since 2005 April 1 with a total exposure of
117 ks (Mostly, in the framework of our ToO requests). During this monitoring,
1ES 0033+595 was one of the bright BL Lac sources in X-rays with the 0.3-10
keV count rate ranging between 1.39+/-0.04 cts/s and 9.24+/-0.13 cts/s,
and exhibiting fast X-ray flares by a factor of 2.2--2.8 (see http://www.swift.psu.edu/monitoring
/source.php?source=1ES0033+595; Kapanadze et al. 2015, Atel#8107). During
these instances, the source also showed a fast flux and spectral variability
down to the  sub-hour timescales.  Furthermore, 1ES 0033+595 generally
showed very hard X-ray spectra with the photon index at 1 keV a=0.93-1.45
and the position of the synchrotron SED peak sometimes moved beyond 10
keV  (that occurs very rarely among BL Lacs; see Kapanadze et al. 2016,
831, 102; 2017, ApJ, 848; 103; MNRAS, 469, 1655; MNRAS, 473, 2542). This
property is explained in the framework of hadronic models more easily than
via the leptonic ones (Sukla et al. 2015, ApJ, 798,2). The last XRT observation
performed on 2018 April 1  has evealed a brightening by 36% to 2.50+/-0.08
cts/s in 4 day. The corresponding 0.3-10 keV spectrum shows a good fit
with the log-parabolic model (the reduced Chi-squared of 1.04 with 52 degrees-f-freedom;
the hydrogen column density fixed to the Galactic value 4.13\times10^{21}
from Kalberla er al. 2005, A&A, 440, 775)  yielding a=0.99+/-0.24,  b=1.06+/-0.31
and the de-absorbed 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.2\times10^{-10} erg/cm^2/s.  In
the framework of one-zone SSC models,  enhanced activity of 1ES 0033+595
is also expected in the UV-radio and gamma-ray parts of the spectrum, and
intensive multiwavelength observations of this source are strongly encouraged.

XRT is one of the Swift instruments along with Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
and UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT). It is a JET-X Wolter I type telescope,
developed jointly by Pennsylvania State University, Brera Astronomical
Observatory (OAB) and University of Leicester. Thanks to the unique characteristics,
good photon statistics and low background counts of this instrument (in
combination with EEV CCD2 detector), we can investigate a flux variability
on different time-scales from minutes to years, obtain high-quality spectra
for the majority of the observations, derive different spectral parameters,
and study their timing behaviour in the 0.3-10 keV range of the electromagnetic
spectrum. The Swift Satellite is operated by Pennsylvania State University.

We report the detection of low-frequency QPOs in the X-ray power spectra
of the new X-ray nova and black hole candidate MAXI J1820+070 (ATEL #11399,
#11400, #11406, #11418, #11423, #11427). The data were collected during
the dedicated ToO observations of the source with INTEGRAL in revolutions
1931-1935 (March 16-27, 2018, ATEL #11478). Since the source is exceptionally
bright (>3.5 Crab in the 15-50 keV band) we, willing to avoid systematic
effects usual for the IBIS/ISGRI data at high count rates, used NRT data
from the SPI telescope in order to perform our timing analysis. We selected
the events with energies in the 20-50 keV range and barycentered their
times of arrival. All the power spectra show a strong band-limited noise
at frequencies below 0.1 Hz. In revolutions 1932-1934 we saw the QPOs with
the centroid frequency growing from 0.030+/-0.001 Hz (in rev. 1932) to
0.035+/-0.001 Hz (rev. 1933) and later 0.042+/-0.001 Hz (rev. 1934). Our
analysis of the JEM-X monitor X-ray data obtained in rev. 1934 has confirmed
the presence of QPOs at 0.04+/-0.01 Hz in the power spectrum of the source
but with smaller confidence.  

Note that the source flux was stable or very slowly increased during this
time interval, according to the Swift-BAT transient monitor data (3.6 Crab
in the middle of rev. 1932 and 3.8 Crab in the middle of rev. 1934). The
similar trend of the flux was found in optical during our photometric and
spectroscopic monitoring of the source at the 1.6-m telescope of the Sayan
observatory. Note also that the observed shape of the power spectrum, with
a broadband noise and a prominent QPO peak, is typical of the low/hard
or hard/intermediate states of black hole transients. 

Follow-up timing observations of the source in X-rays or optical/IR bands
are strongly encouraged. We will also continue to monitor the source.

We report recent optical and near-infrared polarimetric observations of
TXS 0506+056 (ATEL #10773, #10791, #10773, and references therein). We
carried out polarimetric observations of TXS 0506+056 using the Hiroshima
Optical and Near-InfraRed camera (HONIR; Akitaya et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE
9147, 91474) installed to the Cassegrain focus of the 1.5-m Kanata telescope
at the Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory on Mar 22.5, 24.5, and 25.5 (UT).
The measured R-band polarization was 1.8 +/- 0.8%, 6.2 +/- 1.2% and 6.6
+/- 2.3% on Mar 22.5, 24.5 and 25.5, respectively. Steele et al. recently
reported the high polarization degree of 14% on Mar 14 (ATEL #11430). After
that, we find the polarization degree rapidly decreases and returns to
a comparable level of that on 2017, Sep 30 in our previous report (ATEL
#10844). The rapid variation of polarization degree within the past two
weeks is consistent with being a BL Lac object.

INTEGRAL is performing public Target-of-Opportunity observations of the
black-hole binary X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11399). So far,
data have been collected in the period 16-27 March 2018 (see ATels #11478,
#11488). INTEGRAL will continue to publicly monitor the source until further
notice, interspersed with other observations. 

As a service to the community, especially meant to help multi-wavelength
data comparisons, the INTEGRAL Project is providing ready-to-use scientific
data products of all publicly available observations of the source via
the INTEGRAL Science Data Centre (University of Geneva, Switzerland). This
will be in the form of light curves in 1 energy band for JEM-X1 (3-25 keV)
and 2 energy bands for IBIS/ISGRI (25-60 and 60-200 keV). All relevant
information and data files can be retrieved from the repository linked
at the bottom of this Telegram. We caution that these data products are
based on preliminary (near-real time) data and analysis; they will be updated
whenever appropriate. 

We kindly ask anyone making use of these INTEGRAL data products to cite

(1) The spectrum matches that of a normal SN Ia about 12 days after the
B-band maximum. The SN ejecta velocity, deduced from the wavelength of
the  
Si II 635.5 nm minimum, is about 10800 km/s. The redshift of the host galaxy
2MASX J11384720-3310063 is from Huchra et al. 2012, ApJS, 199, 26. <br

The optical transient Gaia18aql/AT2018zo/ATLAS18mgs was detected by Gaia
Science Alerts program on 2018-03-15 in the nucleus of galaxy LEDA 57207
with the previous detection by ATLAS. 

We obtained the spectrum on 2018-03-20 with the FOcal Reducer/low dispersion
Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The spectroscopic
classification was done using SNID code (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666,
1024) and it was matched to SN Type Ia, 21 days past maximum. Estimated
redshift z=0.054 gives the absolute magnitude of the transient of approximately
-18.49 mag. 

The redshift was based on host broad H-alpha line. The spectrum shows blue
continuum with superimposed emission lines of the Balmer series, [O II],
[O III] and S II normal for this SN type.

IGR J17379-3747 is a neutron star low-mass X-ray binary showing Type I
bursts (Chelovekov et al. 2006, AstL, 32, 456; see Chelovekov & Grebenev
2010, AstL, 36, 895 for a correction to the positions reported in the earlier
paper). It experienced two outbursts in the past (2004 and 2008; Chelovekov
& Grebenev 2010) that did not exceed a peak luminosity of ~1E+36 erg/s,
classifying it as a very-faint X-ray transient (Wijnands et al. 2006, A&A,
449, 1117). MAXI/GSC reported renewed X-ray activity of this source on
March 19, 2018 (Atel #11447). We subsequently triggered our joint X-ray
and radio monitoring campaign with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift)
and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA).  

We observed IGR J17379-3747 with the VLA on March 22, 2018 from 12:11 to
13:54 UT (MJD 58199.543 +/- 0.035). These observations were taken simultaneously
at 4.5 and 7.5 GHz, each with a bandwidth of 1 GHz. The VLA was in its
most extended A configuration. 3C286 and J1733-373 were used for primary
and secondary calibration, respectively. Following standard procedures,
we used the Common Astronomy Software Applications package (CASA v4.7.2;
McMullin et al. 2017, ASPC, 376, 127) to calibrate and image the data.
We used Briggs weighting with a robustness of zero to balance sensitivity
and resolution. 

We determined the flux density by fitting a point source in the image plane,
forcing an elliptical Gaussian fit with the size of the synthesized beam
(1.1"" x 0.3"" at 4.5 GHz and 0.69"" x 0.18"" at 7.5 GHz). We measure flux
densities of 431 +/- 7 &mu;Jy at 4.5 GHz and 422 +/- 7 &mu;Jy at 7.5 GHz.
These measurements provide a spectral index of &alpha; = -0.04 +/- 0.05
(where the flux density S<sub>&nu;</sub> &prop; &nu;<sup>&alpha;</sup>).
This spectral index is consistent with a self-absorbed compact jet.  

The best fit source position (taken at 7.5 GHz) is:</br> 
RA (J2000) = 17h 37m 58.836s +/- 0.002 s</br> 
Dec (J2000) = -37d 46' 18.35"" +/- 0.02"",</br> 

where the errors are calculated using the standard VLA astrometric accuracy
of 10% of the synthesized beam. This position is consistent with the enhanced
X-ray position measured with the Swift XRT online pipeline (Goad et al.
2007, A&A, 476, 1401) using the two performed monitoring observations of
the current outburst (RA: 17h 37m 58.82s, Dec: -37d 46' 18.8"", 90% confidence
error radius 2.1"").  

The Swift XRT monitoring observation closest in time to the radio observation
was performed on March 23, 2018 from 13:39 to 13:59 UT. We extract the
PC-mode spectrum using the Swift XRT online pipeline (Evans et al. 2009,
MNRAS, 397, 1177). The spectrum is well described by an absorbed power
law model, yielding an absorption column of N<sub>H</sub>  = (1.7 +/- 0.3)E+22
cm<sup>-2</sup> and a power law photon index of 2.12 +/- 0.16. The addition
of a soft blackbody component does not significantly improve the fit. The
unabsorbed 1-10 keV X-ray flux is (1.76 +/- 0.07)E-10 erg s<sup>-1</sup>
cm<sup>-2</sup>.  

Assuming the peak flux during its X-ray bursts (Chelovekov et al. 2006,
AstL, 32, 456) reached the empirical Eddington limit for a neutron star
(3.8E+38 erg s<sup>-1</sup>; Kuulkers et al. 2003, A&A, 399, 663) places
the source at a distance of approximately 8 kpc. For such a distance, the
radio and X-ray luminosities are 2.0E+29 erg s<sup>-1</sup> and 1.3E+36
erg s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. At this X-ray luminosity, our radio detection
is consistent with the brightest sources in the sample of neutron star
low-mass X-ray binaries (e.g. Deller et al. 2015, ApJ, 809, 13). Although
the radio-brightest neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries include some accreting
millisecond X-ray pulsars and transitional millisecond pulsars, we note
that other examples of these systems are radio-quieter. 

Continuing Swift and VLA monitoring of IGR J17379-3747 is planned. Further
multiwavelength observations are encouraged.

The MAXI/GSC nova-alert system (Negoro et al. 2016) detected the X-ray
brightening from the Be/X-ray binary pulsar 2S 1417-624 on 24 March 2018
(MJD 58201).  The day-averaged 4-10 keV flux indicates that the current
X-ray outburst started from 18 March 2018 (MJD 58195), which corresponds
to the binary orbital phase of 0.31 (P<sub>orb</sub>=42.12d, T<sub>peri</sub>=51485.059(MJD);
Raichur et al. 2010).  The moderate flux increase still continues, and
the 4-10 keV flux has reached 0.0267 +- 0.0087 ph/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (27
+- 8 mCrab) on 25 March 2018 (MJD 58202).  Swift/BAT also observes the
on-going outburst.  The 15-50 keV flux shows the steady increase, and reached
0.0083 +/- 0.0019 counts/s/cm2 (38 +/- 9 mCrab) on 26 March 2018 (MJD 58203).
Before this brightening, Fermi/GBM (Beklen et al. 2009, ATel#2275), Swift/BAT
(Krimm et al. 2009, ATel#2276), and MAXI/GSC observed the giant X-ray outburst
from this source in 2009.  The onset of the previous giant event coincides
with the orbital phase of ~0.3.  Since there are similarities in the outburst
onset phase and the increasing trend, the current outburst might be a giant
one since 2009.  We encourage multi-wavelength observations to monitor
the current event.

"
ATEL #11481,"
The detection of the new black hole candidate MAXI J1807+132 has triggered
a worldwide follow-up campaign from high energies to radio wavelengths
(ATel #11400, #11403, #11418, #11421, #11423, #11424, #11425, #11426, #11427,
#11432, #11437, #11439, #11440, #11445, #11451, #11458 and #11458). As
part of this observational effort, we have performed spectroscopic observations
under our Target of Opportunity programs at both the Gran Telescopio Canarias
(GTC) and the Very Large Telescope (VLT).  These observations are being
performed with the OSIRIS (GTC) and X-Shooter (VLT) spectrographs since
March 16, 2018.  

As previously reported (ATels #11424 and #11425), the optical spectrum
shows the Bowen blend, hydrogen (Balmer and Paschen series) He-I and He-II
emission lines characteristic of low-mass X-ray binaries in outburst. 
Our preliminary analysis of the data taken over 12 different epochs (March
16 to March 26) reveals a clear evolution in the optical spectra. The March
16 observations show asymmetric Balmer and He-I emission profiles, which
are clearly skewed towards the red (see also ATels #11424 and #11425),
while more symmetric profiles are observed from March 17 onwards (see linked
figure below). This, together with the detection of shallow blue-shifted
He-I absorption components in our high signal-to-noise (March 16) X-Shooter
spectra, suggest the presence of a wind outflow with a terminal velocity
of ~1500 km/s during the early stages of the outburst. A similar phenomenology
was observed in the 2015 outbursts of V404 Cyg (Mu&ntilde;oz-Darias et
al. 2016, Nature, 534, 75;  MNRAS 2017, 465 L124). 

The brightness of the source, which has gradually increased from g=12.9
on March 16 to g=12.0 on March 26, allowed us to take spectra with time
exposures as short as 120s, but only relatively minor variations from spectrum
to spectrum are observed within every epoch. For instance, the H-alpha
equivalent width is observed to vary within ~0.5 Ang over 40-min time scales,
while there is an overall increase from ~4 Angs on March 17 to ~9 Angs
on March 26. 

Contemporaneous Swift/XRT X-ray observations show a significant softening
over the above period of time with hardness [(2-10 keV)/ (0.5-2 keV)] evolving
from 0.65 to 0.45. We note that the observations are heavily affected by
pile-up. This was preliminary corrected by excluding the central region
of the aperture from the analysis.  

We are grateful to the GTC and VLT teams for their fast and efficient response
to our ToO triggers.

ToO campaign from 16 March 2018 at 11:07 to 18 March at 12:52 (UTC; satellite
revolution 1931).  

In the near real time (NRT) INTEGRAL data, the source was detected at a
3-20 keV flux of 2.2E-8  ergs/cm^2/s by the two JEM-X units and a 20-500
keV flux of  1.2E-7 ergs/cm^2/s by IBIS/ISGRI. A preliminarily spectral
analysis was carried out using only the IBIS/ISGRI data, due to the limited
accuracy of the JEM-X calibrations in this NRT version of the data. The
ISGRI spectrum (effective exposure time 66 ks) could be well fit (chi^2_reduced/dof
= 0.8/11; 3% systematics included) by using a cutoff power-law with a photon
index of 1.1+/-0.1 and a cutoff energy of 100+/-10 keV.  

Further INTEGRAL observations of the source are already on-going.

TCP J07134590-2112330</a> was discovered by Yuji Nakamura on 2018 March
24.5 UT as a 12 mag optical transient. We obtained spectroscopic observations
of  TCP J07134590-2112330 with the Goodman spectrograph on the 4-m SOAR
telescope on 2018 Mar 25.1 UT, with a low-resolution spectrum (R~1200)
covering 3850--7850 A. The spectrum indicates that TCP J07134590-2112330
is a young classical nova, with strong hydrogen Balmer emission lines and
additional strong lines of [O I] and Fe II. The Balmer lines show P Cygni
profiles; the FWHM of the H alpha emission component is 1250 km/s, and
the absorption trough extends to -2000 km/s.</br> 

Astrometry of the acquisition image implies that this transient is identical
to a source in the Pan-STARRS1 catalog with g=21.5 and r=21.2. The Pan-STARRS1
J2000 position of TCP J07134590-2112330 is RA = 07h13m45.843s , Dec = -21d12'31.28"",
with a catalog uncertainty of about 25 mas per coordinate.

(1) The spectrum of ATLAS18mmu resembles that of the Type Ic SN 2004aw
(Taubenberger et al. 2006, MNRAS, 371, 1459) at the light curve peak. However,
it also shares some similarity with the spectra of 1991T-like SNe slightly
before the maximum light. In both cases, the phases inferred from the spectral
comparisons are inconsistent with the earliest marginal detection reported
by the TNS, while is more consistent with the first multiple ATLAS detections
on March 6, 2018. 
The expansion velocity of the SN ejecta, derived from the minimum of the
Si II 635.5 nm line, is about 10500 km/s. The redshift of the host galaxy,
2MASX J12221040+2659401, is obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Data Release 6.  A narrow absorption feature of Na I at the redshift of
2MASX J12221040+2659401 indicates some internal reddening. <br /> 
(2) The spectrum of PS18nh matches that of a normal Type Ia SN a few days
before the B-band maximum light. The redshift of the host galaxy is obtained
from the positions of the broad SN features. The expansion velocity of
the SN ejecta, as inferred from the minimum of the Si II 635.5 nm line,
is about 12300 km/s. <br /> 
(3) The spectrum of Gaia18arh is similar to that of the Type II-P SN 1999em
(Elmhamdi et al. 2003, MNRAS, 338, 939) about 10 days after the explosion,
and is dominated by H lines with broad P Cygni profiles. He I 587.6 nm
is also detected. The expansion velocity of the SN ejecta derived from
the FWHM of the Halpha emission is 11900 km/s, while from the position
of the minimum of the Hbeta absorption, we obtain a velocity of about 6500
km/s. The redshift of the host galaxy, ESO 216- G 024, is from Fisher et
al. 1995, ApJS, 100, 69. <br /> 
(4) The spectrum of ASASSN-18gf is similar to that of normal Type Ia SNe
soon after the B-band maximum light. The expansion velocity of the SN ejecta,
as inferred from the position of the minimum of the Si II 635.5 nm line,
is about 9400 km/s. The redshift of the host galaxy, 2MASX J15015731+2546168,
is from Sanchez Almeida et al. 2011, ApJ, 735, 125. A narrow absorption
feature of Na I is observed, suggesting significant extinction in the host
galaxy.

ATEL #11473,"
PS18kh (AT 2018zr) was discovered by Pan-STARRS1 on UT 2018-03-02 at i
= 18.63 mag.  The position of the transient was consistent with the center
of the host galaxy (SDSS J075654.53+341543.6) at an unknown redshift. 

As part of the newly formed Spectral Classification of Astronomical Transients
(SCAT) survey utilizing the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS)
on the University of Hawaii 88-inch telescope, we obtained optical spectra
(range 3300-9700 angstroms) on 2018-03-07T07:33 under cloudy conditions
(exposure time 1220s) and 2018-03-18T10:17 under nearly-photometric conditions
(exposure time 2020s).   

We then obtained follow-up low-resolution optical spectra on 2018-03-20.T02:09
with WFCCD mounted on the du Pont 2.5m at Las Campanas Observatory (range
3600-9600 angstroms, exposure time 3300s) and on 2018-03-20.T04:04 with
FAST mounted on the F. L. Whipple Observatory 1.5-m telescope (3500-7300
angstroms, exposure time 1800s).    

These four spectra all show very blue continua with nearly featureless
spectra.  There are potentially very broad Balmer series lines present
at a very rough redshift of z~0.075.  The long time scale, coincidence
with the center of the host galaxy, blue spectra, and potential broad Balmer
lines are all consistent with a tidal disruption event. 

Follow-up observations, especially high S/N spectroscopy, are strongly
encouraged.

(1) The spectrum of SNhunt360 resembles that of a Type Ib SN at the maximum
light, showing the classical features of stripped-envelope SNe  
(Fe II, Mg I, O I, Ca II, Na ID) along with clearly detectable He I lines
(587.6 blended with Na I; 667.8, 706.5 and 728.1 nm). The expansion velocity
of the SN ejecta, as inferred from the position of the minimum of the Si
II 635.5 nm line, is about 13100 km/s, while a velocity of about 11200
km/s is obtained for the He I lines. The redshift of the host galaxy MCG
-01-32-011 is from The 6dF Galaxy Survey Data Release 3 (Jones et al. 2009).
<br /> 
(2) The spectrum of ATLAS18mks is that of an evolved Type II SN. It shows
prominent Balmer lines, and Fe II, Na I and Ca II features with P Cygni
profiles. The broad Halpha emission component (FWHM 8000 ~ km/s) dominates
over the absorption. An unusual absorption feature is visible  
at about 620 nm (rest wavelength), and it can be due to an high-velocity
Halpha component or (more likely)  Si II 635.5 nm. The object was discovered
about three months ago and, later on, experienced a considerable brightening
by about 2 magnitudes. The overall light curve evolution resembles that
of the peculiar SN 1987A. The redshift of the host galaxy, ESO 509- G 095,
is from The 6dF Galaxy Survey Data Release 3 (Jones et al. 2009). <br />

(3) The spectrum of ASASSN-18dt well matches that of the Type Ia SN 2002bo
(Benetti et al. 2004, MNRAS, 348, 261) about 1 month after the B-band maximum
light. The redshift of the host galaxy, 2MASX J14090127-3033321, is from
Huchra et al. 2012, ApJS, 199, 26.

ATEL #11468,"
We report spectroscopic observations of the bright transient ASAS-SN 18fv
(ATel #11454, #11456, #11457, #11460) obtained on 2018 Mar 22 starting
at UT 03:27 from Paranal and using the UVES spectrograph mounted on the
VLT-UT2. The observations cover the spectral range between 3050 and 9500
Angstrom with a resolving power of ~65000. A preliminary analysis of the
combined spectrum shows a bright continuum, resembling an A-type MS star
peaking around 5300 Angstrom, characterised by the presence of hundreds
of narrow absorption features and remarkable Balmer and Paschen jumps. 
We note the presence of a Halpha P-Cygni profile with blue-shifted heliocentric
velocity with a minimum at v $\sim$ -340 km/s, and a narrow emission line
characterised by a measured FWZI = 670 km/s and FWHM = 325 km/s. The brightest
non-Balmer emission line is the O I 7773 line. We also report the presence
of several multiplets of Fe II, with a P-Cygni absorption centered at a
heliocentric velocity of v $\sim$ -250 km/s. This velocity is also reported
for the Na I doublet. The interstellar Na doublet show three resolved components
at heliocentric velocities of -0.2, -3.1 and -13.2 km/s respectively. 

The lack of a strong blue continuum, that is however typical of classical
nova outburst, and the low expansion velocities suggest a possible different
nature for this object. The presence of many narrow absorptions also suggests
a similarity with other peculiar explosions, like the luminous red variable
V4332 Sgr (Martini et al. 1999), the possible luminous red novae V838 Mon
and V1309 Sco (Tylenda et al. 2011, Mason et al. 2010) or the 'helium-flash'
explosion observed in the Sakurai object (Duerbeck and Benetti 1996). Further
spectroscopic observations are important to clarify the nature of this
very interesting target.

ATEL #11469,"
The ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) reported
discovery of a new transient ASSASN-18fs on 2018 March 19. It was detected
at ~13.2 mag in the V band (ATel #11442). The source was not detected at
V>17.6 mag on 2018 March 17. ASAS-SN has monitored this part of the sky
since February 2016 and no previous activity from this source has been
detected. ASSASN-18fs was classified as dwarf nova outburst using follow-up
spectroscopic observations (ATel #11452).

We report on the follow-up Swift observations of the source carried out
on 2018 March 22, <3 days after the source was discovered. All six UV and
optical filters on board the Swift/UVOT were used and the source was observed
for ~720 s (in total, across all six filters). The source is clearly detected
in all the filters. The magnitudes in the Swift/UVOT AB photometric system
from the various filters, along with the 1-sigma errors, are shown below.
The source has dropped by ~1 mag in the V band since its reported detection
~3 days ago.

Filter &emsp;|&emsp; Mag

V &nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;|&emsp; 14.15 +/- 0.04

B &nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;|&emsp; 13.96 +/- 0.03

U &nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;|&emsp; 13.88 +/- 0.03

W1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;|&emsp; 13.92 +/- 0.03

M2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;|&emsp; 14.07 +/- 0.03

W2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;|&emsp; 13.86 +/- 0.03

We also examined the Swift/XRT data and found that the source was barely
detected at ~0.01 c/s. The spectrum extracted from this data had only ~10
counts and was not very constraining. Fitting it with an absorbed power-law
model (with the Nh fixed at ~1.8e21 /cm^2; determined by the Nh along the
line of sight to the source) resulted in a power-law index of ~2. The unabsorbed
(0.5 - 10 keV) flux was 1.2e-12 erg/cm^2/s.

The optical/UV broadband spectral shape as well as the very low X-ray count
rate supports the dwarf nova nature of the source.

We thank the Swift PI Brad Cenko and the Swift team for the rapid execution
of this ToO observation.

During the ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, <a
href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/%61bs/2014ApJ...788...48S"">Shappee et al.

2014</a>), using data from the quadruple 14-cm ""Payne-Gaposchkin"" telescope
in Sutherland, South Africa, we discovered a new transient source, most
likely a 
nova, in the Local Group galaxy NGC 3109. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first nova candidate discovered in NGC 3109. 

ASASSN-18gb (AT 2018akx) was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-03-22.77
at V~17.5 mag. We do not detect (V>18.6) the object in images taken on
UT 2018-03-20.92 and before. An image obtained on 2018-03-23 by J. Brimacombe
confirms the discovery of the transient. This <a

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary

nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx 
(AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin of the transient.

The quasar 3C279 shows a significant increase of optical activity during
the last 10 days. According to monitoring at the Perkins telescope, (Flagstaff,

Russia) telescopes  the magnitude in R band has changed from ~15 to ~13.8
and the degree of polarization (P) has risen from 3% to 30%, while the
position angle of polarization (EVPA) rotates: observations on March 11

ATEL #11472,"
The discovery of the transient ASASSN-18gb was reported in ATel #11470
and it was described as most likely to be a nova eruption in the Local
Group galaxy NGC 3109 - and probably the first nova discovered within that
galaxy. 

We obtained a series of three 600s spectra using the SPRAT (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9147E..8HP"">Piascik
et al. 2014</a>) instrument on the Liverpool Telescope (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5489..679S"">Steele
et al. 2004</a>).  These spectra were taken in relatively poor conditions
at an airmass of almost 2.  They show a noisy continuum, which when combined
show a clear detection of H&alpha; through H&delta; lines, each displaying
the characteristic P Cygni profile seen during the early phase of a nova
eruption. The H&alpha; P Cygni has a terminal velocity of ~2000 km/s. 
There may be tentative evidence for He I and/or Na-D emission lines. But
further spectra are strongly encouraged. 

This spectrum strongly suggests that the initial classification in ATel
#11470 is correct and this is a (the first) nova eruption to be observed
in NGC 3109. The spectrum also indicates that this nova was caught on the
rise, or at least around optical maximum.

In ATel #11458, the correct 2MASS counterpart associated with MAXI J1820+070/ASASSN-18ey

misunderstanding, and thank G. Stringfellow and M. Tanaka for bringing
this to our attention.

The photometric analyses and discussion in ATel #11458 remain unchanged.

ATEL #11466,"
The Asiago Transient Classification Program (Tomasella et al. 2014, AN,
335, 841) reports the spectroscopic classification of  
ASASSN-18fw and ASASSN-18ga, discovered during the ongoing All Sky Automated
Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014). 

The observations were performed with the Asiago 1.82 m Copernico Telescope
equipped with AFOSC (range 320-728 nm; resolution 1.4 nm). 

Survey Name   | IAI Name      | Discovery date (UT)  | Discovery mag  
| Observation (UT)    |  Type  | z         | Notes| 
ASASSN-18fw   | SN2018aki     |  2018-02-21.49       | 17.3           
|2018–02-22 19:21:00  |   Ia   | 0.030211  | (1)  | 
ASASSN-18ga   | SN2018aks     |  2018-02-22.49       | 17.9           
|2018-02-22 21:02:00  |   Ic   | 0.060     | (2)  | 

(1) The noisy spectrum of ASASSN-18fw is consistent with those of Type
Ia SN 2003kf about one week before maximum light.  
The velocity of the ejecta, as measured from SiII 635.5 nm, is around 12500
km/s. 

(2) Noisy spectrum which shows fair matches with normal Type Ic SNe around
maximum light. The redshift has been deduced with SNID. 

Classifications were done with GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488,
383) and SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). The Asiago classification
spectra are posted at the website http://sngroup.oapd.inaf.it.

ATEL #11467,"
We have identified pre-discovery imaging of the probable classical nova
ASASSN-18fv by Evryscope-South (http://evryscope.astro.unc.edu/), an array
of 6-cm telescopes continuously monitoring 8000 square degrees of sky at
2-minute cadence from CTIO, Chile. 

The transient is not detected at UT 2018-03-16.0316 with an upper-limit
of 11.9 +/- 0.1 mag  (g') set by the blended flux from the nearby bright
star (cataloged at V~5.2 in Tycho-2). 

Beginning at UT 2018-03-16.227, we detect a new source at 10.21 +/- 0.05
mag (g'), calibrated using 1817 nearby stars from the AAVSO Photometric
All-Sky Survey DR9 catalog (Henden 2010) with a median residual of 0.04
mag.  The rate of brightening (> 0.8 mag (g') / hour) is consistent with
the V-band measurement by ASAS-SN 2.2 hours later at UT 2018-03-16.32 (ATel
#11454). The transient has since been detected in >1200 Evryscope epochs.

Pre- and post- detection images are available here: http://evryscope.astro.unc.edu/ASASSN-18fv/

ATEL #11464,"
We observed last night the z=0.5362  (Marziani et al. 1996, ApJS, 104,
37) 
flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 (at FK5 coordinates RA 12 56 11.167 
Dec -05 47 21.52 J2000.0) with the 0.3 m telescope at the Astronomical

Observatory of the University of Siena. This observation was performed

within the frame of a guidance project about astrophysics involving high

school students from the Liceo ""Galileo Galilei"" (Siena). 
</BR> 
</BR> 
Observation of this target was performed as follow-up of the current active
state announced in the gamma-ray band by 
the Fermi/LAT collaboration (ATel #11189) and followed by many ground-based
and orbiting instruments observing at all wavelengths (ATel 
#11190,#11196,#11200,#11202,#11216,#11239,#11246,#11354). Observations
consist of  3 x 300 s exposures in the Johnson-Cousins 
R filter, taken in 2x2 binning under good observing conditions with clear

sky and seeing 4.8"" (FWHM), starting on Mar 21.11 . The source altitude
was about 31 degrees during the observation. 
</BR></BR> 
After dark current subtraction and flat field correction images were averaged

and preliminary photometric analysis was performed by means of the MaximDL

software package. Reference and check stars in the field of view were taken

from the finding chart made available by Landessternwarte Koenigstuhl at

https://www.lsw.uni-heidelberg.de/projects/extragalactic/charts/1253-055.html

. The reference R magnitudes for these stars are taken from Villata et

al., A&AS 130, 305 (1998).   
</BR> 
</BR> 
We obtained for 3C 279 a magnitude R=14.02 +- 0.01 on Mar 22.12. Quoted
uncertainty is statistical only. Measurement 
comes from a preliminary photometric analysis and may be subject to later

refinement. This value is  about 1 magnitude below the latest R-band measurement
made publicly available by the Tuorla Observatory  at http://users.utu.fi/kani/1m/3C_279_l.png
and relative to an observation performed on Mar 19. We can also compare
this measurement 
with the previous observations performed within our blazar monitoring program
and shown in the following table:

2018 Mar 22.12 14.02 0.01 </BR> 
</BR> 
</BR> 

Our dataset alone hints to a rebrightening of the optical active state
of the blazar, while the comparison with latest Tuorla observations adds
that there was a recent and rather rapid increase in the flux following
a period of few nights of apparent stability around R=15.0. This might
be related to the onset of a bright sub-flare. We will continue monitoring
the source in the following nights. Multi-wavelength follow-up is strongly
encouraged.

Marchini (alessandro.marchini@unisi.it) or to Giacomo Bonnoli (giacomo.bonnoli@unisi.it).

ATEL #11455,"
The Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar PKS 0346-27 underwent a strong Gamma-ray
flare on 2018-02-02 (Angioni et al., ATel #11251). Optical/NIR follow up
with the REM telescope (Nesci, ATel #11269) on 2018-02-07 showed the source
in a bright state also in this frequency range. Independent indication
of an optical peak on 2018-02-21 was given by the ASAS-SN survey (Vallely
et al., ATel #11337). Archival observations of the Catalina Sky Survey
DR2 (Drake, A.J. et al.  2009, ApJ, 696, 870) from 2005 to 2013 indicate
an optical variability amplitude of more than 2 magnitudes, but never brighter
than V=17.8. 

We obtained a ToO exposure of 2300s with Swift-XRT and UVOT on 2018-03-19:
PKS0346-27 was found at U=15.65 +-0.01 mag with a count-rate of 0.0704
+-0.0062 c/s in the 0.2-10 keV range. Spectral analysis with the interactive
tool of the ASI SSDC gave a reasonable fit with a power-law photon index
-2.08+-0.23, and a reduced chi2=0.44. The total flux in the 0.4-10 keV
range is 2.0E-12 erg/cm2/s. 
In a log(nu)-log(nu*F_nu) plot (Fig.1) the X-ray SED is practically flat,
suggesting that in this energy range the contribution of Synchrotron emission
and Inverse Compton emission are comparable. 

The archival Swift observation in 2009-03-29 (3362s) gave U=17.53+-0.04
(U-V=-0.64) and an X-ray count rate of only 0.0174 +-0.0025 c/s, not enough
to derive a meaningful spectral index. The ratio of the X-ray count rates
between the two epochs is about 4.0 +-0.9, slightly smaller than the optical
(U) flux ratio 5.6+-0.3.

The Fermi-LAT public data show that PKS 0346-27 is still much brighter
than the quiescent level. Our REM monitoring is still ongoing. Radio observations
at high frequency would be desirable to better constraint the emission
model of this flare. 

Fig. 1  shows the SED of PKS 0346-27 on 2018-03-19 from simultaneous Swift
and REM data (crosses). The large dots are the UVOT data on 2009-03-29
and the XRT X-ray flux estimated from the count-rate, assuming the same
photon index of the recent observation.

ATEL #11456,"
We obtained a spectrum of ASASSN-18fv (ATel #11454), the new bright Galactic
transient, with the Du Pont 2.5-m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory
on UT 2018 Mar 21. The underlying spectrum appears to be that of an early
K star, but we also observe P Cygni profiles in many lines: H-alpha, the
Ca triplet, O I 7773, Mg I 5173, and several Fe II lines. The emission
and absorption profiles are both unresolved at our ~ 400 km/s FWHM resolution.
The higher order Balmer lines are seen only in absorption, and Paschen
absorption is also present. There is an overall increase in the continuum
emission between ~ 8300 and 9300 A that appears as a ""bump"" in the spectrum,
but no obvious broad molecular features are apparent. 

We also corrected the astrometry of our acquisition image using a large
number of Gaia DR1 stars. After doing so, we find that the transient matches
to within 0.1"" a star in the Gaia DR1 catalog, which has a J2000 position
of 10:36:15.4138 -59:35:53.648. This star is also present in VPHAS+ DR2
catalog (Drew et al 2014, MNRAS, 440, 2036), with g~20.1 and r ~ 19.5.
From spectrophotometry of the fluxed spectrum and a first-order slit correction,
we find  magnitudes of g=7.80, r=7.27, i=7.19, B=8.07, V=7.45. The absolute
fluxing is likely uncertain at the 10-20% level, but the colors (g-r =
0.53; B-V = 0.62) should be more reliable. The outburst g magnitude of
7.8 implies that the object has brightened by at least -12.3 mag in g.

The strong, stellar-like underlying continuum and the narrow nature of
the emission lines suggest that this transient is not likely to be a classical
nova, though this cannot be definitively exluded. Instead, noting that
this source is < 10 pc from the main nebulosity of the Carina Nebula, the
transient may be a large outburst of a young stellar object. Other exotic
explanations that show low expansion velocities, such as stellar mergers,
may also be plausible. High-resolution optical/IR spectroscopy of this
unusual transient is urgently required.

"
ATEL #11457,"
We report follow-up B and V photometry of Galactic transient ASASSN-18fv
(Stanek et al. ATEL #11454). The photometry was taken with the 14-inch
telescope at Hutton-Westfold Observatory, located at Monash University's
Clayton campus. Adopting B=6.249 and V=5.088 for nearby star HD 92063 and
using 20-arcsecond diameter aperture photometry, we find ASASSN-18fv had
magnitudes of B=7.19 and V=6.62 at UT 2018-3-21.47. 

Our photometry is considerably brighter than the discovery photometry of
Stanek et al. (ATEL 11454), who noted their photometry was potentially
compromised by saturation and confusion. Additional UBVRI images and low
resolution slitless spectroscopy (with a 200 line/mm diffraction grating)
are being obtained with the Hutton-Westfold Observatory's 11-inch and 14-inch
telescopes. 

"
ATEL #11458,"
We report near-infrared JHKs band photometric observations of the newly
discovered X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 (Atel #11399, #11403, #11406),
associated with ASASSN-18ey which began brightening in the optical on March
06 (ATel #11400).

These observations were carried out on 2018 March 18 between 23:33 and
23:49 UT using the 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), situated at Hanle
and operated by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. Imaging
was in dithered mode and consisted of five exposures each in three dithered
positions, with each exposure 20 seconds long.

The transient can be associated with the 2MASS object (2MASS 18201471+0710574)
having Vega magnitudes in J, H and Ks bands of 15.87 +/- 0.07, 15.44 +/-
0.10 and 15.12 +/- 0.12 respectively. Reduction of the data were carried
out using PSF photometry. The derived instrumental magnitudes when calibrated
against two stars in the same field namely 2MASS 18201851+0710328 and 2MASS
18202643+0710117 gave the following brightness of the source in the near-IR
bands:

J = 11.12 +/- 0.08

H = 10.24 +/- 0.04

Ks = 9.54 +/- 0.04

These magnitudes have been not corrected for Galactic extinction. Comparison
of our observations with the 2MASS magnitudes indicates that the source
has brightened by 4.75, 5.20 and 5.58 mag in J, H and Ks bands.

Ks-band monitoring with HAWK-I/VLT and the above 2MASS association have
also been reported by Casella et al. (ATel #11451), with our HCT observations
preceding theirs by about 9 hours. Our Ks band measurement is about 0.7
mag brighter than the average mag reported by Casella et al., likely indicative
of strong variations on min-hours timescales, in addition to the faster
variability seen in HAWK-I.

The above 2MASS mags correspond to flux densities of ~57 (J), 82 (H) and
102 mJy (Ks; Cohen, Wheaton & Megeath 2003 AJ 126 1090). Galactic extinction
corrections are likely to be <17%, <10% and <7%, respectively, based upon
the range of optical extinction estimates reported so far (ATel #11418,
#11437, #11445) and for a typical Galactic reddening law (Fitzpatrick 1999
PASP 111 755). This implies that the near-infrared flux density rises to
longer wavelengths, possibly consistent with optically-thin jet emission.
There is multiwavelength spectral and timing evidence supporting the presence
of jet activity (e.g. ATel #11420, #11426, #11437, #11439, #11440, #11451).

X-ray spectral modeling of a Swift Window Timing mode XRT observation from
the same day (ObsID 00010627007 with an observation time of 2018-03-18T02:52:56)
is consistent with an approximate power law fit of photon-index 1.52 +/-
0.03 (68% confidence error) over the 3-9 keV range, with chi^2/dof=641/581
and Flux(3-9)~1.3x10^{-8} erg/s/cm^2. The H-band and 3-9 keV fluxes place
the source close to the hard state outburst rise track of the black hole
binary GX 339-4 (Coriat et al. 2009 MNRAS 400 123).

We will attempt to carry out further observations of this ongoing transient.

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient.

ATEL #11460,"
Observations of ASASSN-18fv (ATel# 11454) were obtained on 2018 Mar. 21.49
(MJD 58199.0), with an Alpy600 spectrograph having a resolution of about
540 in the range 3800-7300A using a Atik414 CCD and a total exposure time
5x120 sec.  The spectrum  confirms that this source is a classical nova
on the rise in the optically thick (Fe curtain) phase,  The Fe II 5018,
5169 lines, for instance, show absorption troughs (about as strong as the
emission) extending to about -800 km/s, about the same as the zero intensity
width of the redshifted emission wing.  The Balmer lines (H-alpha to H-gamma)
show absorption with similar maximum  velocities and strongly decreasing
emission-to-absorption ratio with increasing line number, similar profiles
and kinematics are found on Si II 6347,6371 and other metallic ion lines.
Ca II H and K are mainly in absorption, as are the Na I D lines, but the
absorption is displaced by about   But in both cases the profiles are broad
and poorly resolved, although the Na I D is centered at about vrad=0 km/s
while Ca II K has a vrad ~ -400 km/s deepest absorption and a similar maximum
absorption velocity, suggesting the Na I line is dominated by interstellar
absorption.  Neither O I nor He I are seen in this spectrum.  The optical
depth is quite large now and, with these absorption velocities, it would
be of interest to obtain high resolution time sequences to study the appearance
of multiple absorption systems and track the changes in ejecta transparency.

We present the first classifications from the newly formed Spectral Classification
of Astronomical Transients (SCAT) survey.  SCAT is a transient identification
survey utilizing the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) on the
University of Hawaii (UH) 88-inch telescope. 

We report optical spectroscopy (range 330-970 nm) of four supernovae discovered
by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS, Tonry et al.
2011, PASP, 123, 58) and one supernova discovered by the All-Sky Automated
Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014, ApJ, 788, 48).  We
performed a cross-correlation with a library of supernovae spectra using
the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, Ap.J.
666, 1024).  The details of the classifications are as follows:

Following the detection of the newly discovered X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070

(ATel #11399, #11400, #11403, #11404, #11406, #11418), we have started
a  
polarimetric monitoring campaign of the source. Here we report the first
detection  
of the linear polarization obtained on March 18, 2018, around 14:52 UTC

(JD 2458196.120). The measurements were done with the Dipol-2 polarimeter,
which  
is currently installed on the Tohoku 60cm (T60) telescope at Haleakala
Observatory,  
Hawaii. Observations have been made simultaneously in the Johnson-Cousins
B, V  
and R-bands over the time interval of approximately two hours. The total
number of  
single measurements of the normalized Stokes parameters is 48. The average
values  
of linear polarization and polarization angle for the B, V and R-bands
are given below: 

B-band: P = 0.74 +/- 0.02(%), Theta = 53.0 +/- 0.7(deg); 
V-band: P = 0.71 +/- 0.03(%), Theta = 53.6 +/- 1.1(deg); 
R-band: P = 0.78 +/- 0.02(%), Theta = 54.5 +/- 0.7(deg). 

Thus the measured magnitude of linear polarization is below 1%. The value
of  
interstellar polarization in the direction of the MAXI J1820+070 can be
estimated  
from the reddening of the source, given that normally polarization degree
PD(ISM)  
< 9 x E(B-V). An estimate of the reddening was given in ATel#11418 E(B-V)
= 0.167, that  
corresponds to a Hydrogen column density of NH = 1.12 x 10^21 cm-2. However,
in the  
Swift/XRT spectrum taken on March 13, 2018 (OBSID: 00010627002) the best
fitting  
hydrogen column was an order of magnitude lower, NH = 1.2 (\pm 0.4) x 10^20
cm-2,  
which gives a much lower reddening estimate, AV= 0.055 (Guver & Ozel, 2009)
or  
AV= 0.067, if one uses the relation of Predehl and Schmitt NH=AV x 1.8E21.
For these  
lower values we get E(B-V) = AV/RV = 0.015 or 0.019, respectively, assuming
RV=3.6. The  
discrepancy between the extinction values suggests that MAXI J1820+070
is closer to the  
Earth than the majority of the ISM in that direction. 

If the correct reddening corresponds to these low values measured from
the X-ray  
spectrum, the measured polarization degrees are significantly above the
expected  
interstellar polarization level. For the higher reddening values, the observed
polarization  
is consistent with that coming from the ISM. Further observations of the
source are planned  
in order to detect variations and to verify if the measured polarization
is intrinsic.

The optical transient Gaia18aoq/AT2018aev was discovered by Gaia Science
Alerts program on 2018-01-31. The transient was coinciding with the nucleus
of 2MASX J13550786-3823227. 

We obtained the spectrum on 2018-03-14 with the FOcal Reducer/low dispersion
Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The spectroscopic
classification was done using SNID code (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666,
1024) and it was matched to SN Type IIP, 9 days past maximum. Estimated
redshift z=0.026 gives the absolute magnitude of the transient of approximately
-16.84 mag. 
The redshift was based on host broad H-alpha line. The spectrum shows blue
continuum with superimposed emission lines of the Balmer series, [O II],
[O III] and faint S II and H-beta .

The MAXI/GSC nova alert system  (Negoro et al. 2016, PASJ, 68, S1) triggered
on a faint X-ray transient source at 19:01 UT on March 19 2018 in 1d and
4d time bins. Assuming that the source flux was constant over each transit
at 14:23 and 17:28 on the same day, we obtain the source position at

(R.A., Dec) = (264.733 deg, -37.948 deg) = (17 38 55, -37 56 52) (J2000)

with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short
radii of 0.41 deg and 0.34 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long
axis from the north direction is 180.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an
additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius).
The X-ray flux averaged over the two scans  was 37 +- 11 mCrab (4.0-10.0keV,
1 sigma error). 
Preliminary GSC data analysis showed that the source flux in the 4-10 keV
band has been increasing since March 14, whereas the 2-4 keV flux rapidly
increased to about 20 mCrab on March 14 and declined. 

The gamma-ray source IGR J17379-3747 (Bird et al. 2007, ApJS, 170, 175,
also see Curran et al. 2013, arXiv 1107.2045v1) lies 0.26 deg from the
center of the above error region. Interestingly, Swift/BAT 15-50 keV data
(Krimm et al. 2013, ApJSS 209, 14; https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/weak/IGRJ17379-3747/)
also showed slight increase in the X-ray flux on March 14-18, but which
was not significant on March 19 ((-0.2+/-3.0)e-3 c/cm2/s). On the other
hand, the INTEGRAL Galactic Bulge Monitoring Program (Kuulkers et al. 2003,
A&A, 466, 595; http://integral.esac.esa.int/BULGE/SOURCES/IGR_J17379-3747/IGR_J17379-3747.html)
data demonstrate a long-term upward trend in hard X-rays for about 100
days.

IGR J17379-3747 exhibited outbursts on February 2004 and September 2008
(e.g., ATel #1709, #1711, #1714; also see by C. Markwardt https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Craig.Markwardt//galscan/html/XTE_J1737-376.html).
MAXI/GSC data also showed weak 2-10 keV X-ray enhancement (~10 mCrab) probably
from this source in the middle of February 2014. These suggest that IGR
J17379-3747  undergoes outbursts every 4-5 years.

ATEL #11451,"		Transient

We report on near-infrared fast-photometry observations of the newly discovered
X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11399, #11400, #11406, #11418, #11420,
, #11421, #11423, #11424, #11425, #11426, #11427, #11432, #11437, #11439,
#11440, #11445), carried out with HAWK-I at VLT/Paranal.

HAWK-I observed the target on Mar 19, 2018, between 08:27 and 09:09 UT,
in Ks filter. We used the FastJitter mode, with 64-px windows and a DIT=250
milliseconds. The night was photometric, with a variable seeing between
0.5 and 1.0 arcseconds.

The source is clearly detected in each single DIT. Its position is consistent
with a 2MASS object (K = 15.12 +/- 0.12), but appears to have brightened
substantially.

Preliminary analysis shows the source is rather variable, with an average
magnitude of Ks ~ 10.2 and a ~25% average rms variability.

The magnitude - not corrected for the Galactic extinction - was calibrated
against a nearby field comparison star (2MASS 18202191+0711248, K = 12.029
+/- 0.027).

According to our photometry, the target has brightened by almost two orders
of magnitude in Ks with respect to the 2MASS value, which likely corresponds
to the quiescence of the object (ATel #11418).

Two additional epochs of fast IR photometry are planned for March 22nd
and 27th, around the same UT range (end of 21st and 26th Chilean nights)™.
Multi-wavelength coverage is highly encouraged, especially but not only
at high high time resolution and/or at longer wavelengths than near-infrared.

ASASSN-18fs was recently discovered as a possible Galactic nova (ATel #11442).
We obtained a spectrum of ASASSN-18fs with the Du Pont 2.5m telescope at
Las Campanas Observatory on UT 2018 Mar 20. The spectrum shows broad H-alpha
and HeII 4686 emission and broad absorption in Hbeta and higher-order Balmer
lines. These features are consistent with a dwarf nova outburst, and we
classify this source as a cataclysmic variable rather than a classical
nova.

ASASSN-18fv was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-03-20.32

at the location of ASASSN-18fv. No previous outbursts or variability 
are detected at the position of ASASSN-18fv since ASAS-SN started 
observing this location in February 2016.

Note that ASASSN-18fv is saturated in ASAS-SN data  
(<a href=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/asassn/followup/asassn-18av.jpg>see

signal of a bright new source on several nights and multiple images, so
this 
is a secure detection.

Follow-up observations, especially spectroscopy, are strongly encouraged.

Peter Dunsby (University of Cape Town) reports the detection of a very
bright optical transient in the region between the Lagoon and Trifid Nebulae
based on observations obtained from Cape Town on 20 March 2018, between
01:00 and 03:45 UT.  

The object was visible throughout the full duration of the observations
and not seen when this field was observed previously (08 March 2018). 

The optical transients is at least first magnitude and is located at the
following coordinates: 
RA (2000):  18h 04m 50s 
Declination (2000.0): -23d 29m 58s 

The coordinates are accurate to a few arcseconds. There is no obvious counterpart
at this position on the Digital Sky Survey plates. 

Observations were obtained using an 80mm refractor. The attached URL show
the image of this field (2.3 x 1.7 degrees, plate scale of 9 arcseconds
per pixel) on 20 March 2018. The optical transient is the brightest star
in the field. 

Further observations are strongly encouraged to establish the nature of
this very bright optical transient.

We have observed the new X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11399, #11400,

with the RATAN-600 radio telescope (SAO RAS, http://www.sao.ru) at 4.7,
8.2 and 11.2  GHz on March 18 2018 (MJD 58195.161). We have measured the
flux densities 62 +/- 4, 56 +/- 5, and 61 +/- 5 mJy at these frequencies
respectively. Thus the instantaneous radio spectrum was almost flat, the
spectral index is equal to -0.04. The recent radio measurement 15 mJy at
15 GHz (Bright et al., ATel #11420) were made with AMI-LA on 14 March 2018.
Probably we see a radio flare from this black hole X-ray binary related
with relativistic jets formation. We continue monitoring of this source
in the long-term  multi-frequency monitoring program of microquasars with
RATAN-600.

"
ATEL #11440,"
We performed target-of-opportunity observations of the newly-discovered
candidate black hole X-ray binary, MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11399, #11400,
#11404, #11406, #11418, #11420, #11421, #11423, #11424, #11425, #11426,
#11427, #11432, #11437, #11439), with the Northern Extended Millimetre
Array (NOEMA), as part of the JACPOT XRB project. 

Our NOEMA observations occurred on 2018-03-16, with scans on source from
05:25 to 07:44 UTC (MJD=58193.2257-58193.3222), in the 3mm (97.5 GHz) band.
MAXI J1820+070 was significantly detected as a point source, with a preliminary
flux density of 30 +/- 3 mJy, measured in the UV-plane (where the uncertainty
on the flux density represents a 10% error on the absolute flux scale).
Adverse weather conditions prevented us from obtaining observations of
MAXI J1820+070 in the 2mm (140 GHz) and 1mm (230 GHz) bands. 

With these data, we measure the position of the source to be,</br> 
RA(J2000) = 18h20m21.94 +/- 0.001s (0.02&#34;)</br> 
DEC(J2000) = +07d11&#39;07.24 +/- 0.06&#34;</br> 

This position lies within the X-ray error circle (1.33 arcsec separation;
ATel #11406), and is consistent with the reported optical position (0.05
arcsec separation from a star in archival Gaia DR1 data; ATel #11424, and
0.6 arcsec separation from ASASSN-18ey; ATel #11400). 

Sub-mm detections of black hole X-ray binaries typically arise from a compact
synchrotron-emitting jet in the hard state, characterized by a flat to
slightly inverted, optically thick spectrum (S_&nu; &prop; nu^&alpha;,
spectral index &alpha;&ge;0), originating from overlapping self-absorbed
synchrotron contributions from different regions along the jet. Given our
sub-mm flux, and the radio flux from a new AMI radio observation (that
was taken simultaneously with our NOEMA observations) of 29 +/- 3 mJy,
we derive a radio through sub-mm spectral index of 0.02+/-0.09 (consistent
with the flat radio spectrum reported in ATel #11439). This AMI flux corresponds
to a radio luminosity of (3.32 +/- 0.34)E31*(d/8kpc)^2 erg/s). 

Swift/XRT observed MAXI J1820+070 on 2018-03-16 between 03:01:32 and 03:17:56
UTC. We extracted the data using the online XRT pipeline (Evans et al.
2009) and fit with an absorbed power-law model. We find a best fit with
an N_H of (3.0 +/- 0.5)E20 cm<sup>-2</sup> and a photon index of 1.50 +/-
0.02, providing an unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux of (8.96 +/- 0.08)E-9
erg/s/cm^2, corresponding to a 0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity of (6.87 +/-
0.15)E37*(d/8kpc)^2 erg/s (all errors are 1-sigma). The X-ray and radio
luminosities reported here are consistent with evidence at other wavelengths
that suggest the source is a black hole X-ray binary in the rising hard
state (ATel #11427, #11432). 

We will continue to monitor the source at sub-mm frequencies. 

We thank the IRAM NOEMA staff for rapidly scheduling our observations and
the AMI scheduling team for their continued monitoring of the source.

525 km/s, with wings extending to roughly +/-1000 km/s.   This suggests
a Type IIn classification. Additionally, however, narrow emission lines
of [Ca II] 7291,7324 and intermediate-width emission lines of Ca II 8498,
8542, 8662 are seen.  The presence of the calcium emission lines combined
with an absolute magnitude of -12.6 (using a distance modulus of NGC5300
from NED of 30.96) indicate that this object may be a supernova impostor

time resolutions of 66.294- and 6.149-msec by using a wide-field CMOS camera,
Tomo-e Gozen (Sako et al. 2016, SPIE, 9908, 99083P; Ohsawa et al. 2016,

We have analysed the Swift/BAT data of the new transient MAXI J1820+070

(Atel #11399,#11400, #11403, #11404, #11406, #11418, #11420, #11421, #11423,#11424,

collected from 2018-03-07 00:41:07 until 2018-03-15 06:20:58. 

The hard X-ray flux of MAXI J1820+070 was rapidly increasing: 
on March 15th it reached 1 Crab, 1.5 Crab and 1.8 Crab in the energy ranges

15-40 KeV and 40-80 keV and 80-150 keV, respectively. 
Despite the strong flux variation the source show a constant hardness ratio.

The 15-200 keV spectrum of MAXI J1820+070, averaged in the time interval
MJD 58190.004-58192.264 (about 42 ks exposure), is well fit by the thermal
Comptonisation model NTHCOMP  (reduced Chi^2=1.07(172)). 
It results in a photon index Gamma=1.54+/-0.01 and an electron temperature
kTe=65+/-7 keV 
that are typical parameters of the hard spectral state observed in black
hole binaries.

ATel #11419 reports enhanced Gamma Ray Activity of TXS 0506+056 detected
by Fermi-LAT on 2018 March 13.  A previous Fermi-LAT high state of this
source in the period 2017 Sept 15-27 was potentially associated with the
Ice Cube Neutrino detection 170922A (ATel #10791).  TXS 0506+056 is a BL
Lac object (e.g. ATel #10799) with redshift z=0.34 (Paiano et al, 2018,
ApJ, 854, L32). 

We obtained optical polarimetry of the BL Lac object on the night of 2018
March 14 using the RINGO3 polarimeter of the 2.0 metre Liverpool Telescope,
La Palma.  We find the polarisation is moderately strong (P~14%) at wavelengths
roughly corresponding to the R and I bands.  This is an increase from the
R band polarisation P~8% reported in ATel #10844 from the Katana telescope
at the time of the previous high state on 2017 Sept 30, although it is
within the typical range of BL Lac optical polarisation values of 0-30%
(see e.g. Figure 4 of Jermak et al, 2016, MNRAS, 462, 4267).

A fast radio burst has been detected at the Parkes Telescope on 
2018-03-11 at 04:11:54.80 UTC (ATeL #11396). The INTEGRAL observatory 
was taking data on a field centered at RA=260.177, Dec=-40.105, 43.0 
degrees from the approximate FRB arrival direction (RA=21:31:33.42 
Dec=-57:44:26.7). This orientation is rather favorable for a detection

of any associated gamma-ray transient with INTEGRAL's all-sky 
detectors (see <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...603A..46S"">Savchenko
et al., 2017, A&A 603, A46</a> for details). The best constraints can be
achieved using the anti-coincidence shield ofthe spectrometer (SPI-ACS)
or the imager (IBIS/ISGRI), depending on 
the assumed source spectrum and exact location. We inspected these 
data, which have a stable background within at least a 10-minute 
window of the FRB occurrence time, and derive an upper limit on any 
associated impulsive gamma-ray transient. 

We estimate a 3-sigma upper limit on the 75-2000 keV fluence of 2.6e-7

erg/cm<sup>2</sup> for a burst lasting less than 1 s with a characteristic
short 
GRB spectrum (an exponentially cut-off power-law with alpha=-0.5 and 
Ep=600 keV) occurring at any time in the interval within 300 s around 
T<sub>0</sub>. For a typical long GRB spectrum (Band function with alpha=-1,

beta=-2.5, and Ep=300 keV), the derived fluence upper limit in 8 s is 
7.1e-7 erg/cm<sup>2</sup> in the 75-2000 keV energy range. The limits are

applicable within at least 5 deg around the approximate FRB180311 
position.

ATEL #11432,"
MAXI J1820+070 is a new X-ray transient discovered on 2018 March 11 12:50
UT by MAXI (ATel #11399), and associated with a bright optical transient
ASASSN-18ey (ATel #11400). It has already been the focus of several observing
campaigns over a very short time span, including Swift (ATel #11403, #11404,
#11406, #11427), MAXI (ATel #11406), Faulkes/LCO (ATel #11418), AMI (ATel
#11420), Sarah L. Krizmanich Telescope (ATel #11421), NICER (ATel #11423),
SOAR (ATel #11424), Keck (ATel #11425), and Kiso Schmidt (ATel #11426).
These observations have noted its rapid brightening, fast optical variability,
and sub-second flaring. They also indicate a nature consistent with a black
hole X-ray binary in the hard state (http://www.faulkes-telescope.com/1820).

We report now on correlated optical and X-ray observations by Neil Gehrels
Swift Observatory UVOT/XRT (ObsID: 00010627003). The observation was carried
out on 2018 March 15, starting at 01:39 (UT), for a duration of 1.8 ks
(XRT) and 1.2 ks (UVOT). UVOT was employed in the event mode with the v-filter
and XRT was in Windowed Timing Mode. Standard extraction steps were used
for selecting and accumulating source counts and constructing light curves.
Example light curves using 1 s binning are shown at the link below. No
time frame corrections have been included since both lightcurves are from
Swift.

The mean count rates are ~184 ct/s (XRT full band) and ~100 ct/s (UVOT).
The X-ray data were extracted from the Swift Online Tool. The mean signal/noise
in UVOT is ~7, and the fractional optical rms of the source (after removing
shot noise contribution) is ~9%, typical of hard-state outbursts (e.g.
Gandhi et al. 2010 MNRAS 407 2166).

A Discrete Correlation Function analysis (Edelson & Krolik, 1988 ApJ 333
646) shows the optical signal lagging the X-rays by a few seconds or shorter
(see link below). This lag is also evident by eye in the light curves showing
correlated flares. The bulk of the correlation appears to be concentrated
below a lag of 10 s. These lags are shorter than UVOT lags reported in
the case of the rise of V404 Cyg (ATel #7727). If these lags are related
to canonical reprocessing of X-rays to the optical, they constrain the
size of the disc to be <~0.2 x that of V404 Cyg, or an orbital period of
<~15 h x (M/10Msun)^(-0.5), where M is the system mass. This assumes a
disk size of ~45 light seconds and an orbital period of 6.5 days for V404
Cyg (Casares et al. 1992 Nature 355 614).

There is some evidence of additional sub-second delays, but these must
be confirmed with more sensitive data. It is not uncommon for transient
black hole binary outbursts to display multi-component optical variability
and delays originating in separate processes (e.g. Gandhi et al. 2010 MNRAS
407 2166).

Swift BAT reports that the source is continuing to increase in X-rays (https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/weak/MAXIJ1820p070/).
The latest optical data shows the source currently at V~13 (ATel #11418).

More observations are currently planned for this source. ULTRACAM will
attempt to observe from approximately 08:30 to 09:40 (UT) when possible
until March 23, and there are also observations by VLBA, INTEGRAL, AMI,
XMM and NOEMA currently scheduled. More information on these observations
can be found on SMARTNet, where people are encouraged to sign in: www.isdc.unige.ch/smartnet/

In the interests of multiwavelength astronomy, and considering the bright
and intriguing nature of this source, we therefore welcome any and all
possible observations.

We would like to extend our profound thanks to the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory
Team for their rapid approval scheduling of these observations, in particular
PI Brad Cenko. We would also like to acknowledge discussions with Andy
Beardmore, Sam Oates and Dave Russell.

We obtained spectroscopic observations of SN 2018agk with the Goodman spectrograph
on the 4-m SOAR telescope on 2018 Mar 16 UT. The spectrum indicates that
SN 2018agk is a young Type Ia supernova.  Using SNID (Blondin & Tonry,
2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), we find a good match to several Type Ia SNe 3-10
days before maximum brightness. We note that the small number of SNe Ia
observed at very early phases often results in a bias to later phases.
The SN was discovered at 20.2 mag, which assuming a distance modulus of
35.3 mag for the host galaxy IC 855 (based on its redshift), corresponds
to an absolute magnitude of -15.2 -- or ~4 mag below peak brightness. We
measure an Si II 6355 velocity of -11,200 km/s. We detect a possible C
II 6580 feature (an additional indication of a young age) with a velocity
of -11,300 km/s.

The optical transient OGLE18wc = AT2018wc was detected on 2018-02-16  
during a dedicated search for fast transients CORTE (Chile-OGLE  
Rapid Transients Experiment). The flare lasted three days, reached  
about 19.1 mag in OGLE I-band at maximum (host subtracted) and  
coincided with the nucleus of a small galaxy. 

The galaxy coincided with WISE J051811.72-514404.0, a candidate  
BL Lac type object identified by D'Abrusco et al. (2014, ApJS, 215,  
14) on the basis of its WISE colors and identification with  
the radio source SUMSS J051811-514404 (76.0 mJy at 843 MHz; Mauch  
et al. 2003, MNRAS, 342, 1117). The radio source is also detected  
with astrometric VLBI: 05:18:11.727160, -51:44:03.97925 +/-2.6 mas 
J2000 (30 mJy at 8.4 GHz; Petrov and Kovalev, in preparation  
http://astrogeo.org/ ). The X-ray source XMMSL2 J051811.6-514354 is  
located 10"" away and, despite the reported 4.3"" uncertainty in its  
position, is likely associated with the transient.  

We obtained a spectrum of OGLE18wc on 2018-02-19 using the  
VLT/FORS2 with grism 600V (3500-6300A). Additional low resolution  
spectra were obtained with SALT/RSS (3500-9200A) on 2018-02-20 and  
2018-03-04. The spectra suggest rapid evolution, but the difference  
between the VLT and SALT spectra can be also partly attributed to  
the slit alignment. The first (VLT) spectrum shown Hb, Hg, [OIII]  
and [OII] emission lines and absorption lines of Ca II H&K, G-band  
and Mg I at z=0.22. In the second (SALT) spectrum Hb disappears,  
strong Iron complexes 4500A and 5500A are present. A broad Ha alpha  
is visible having FWHM~4000km/s. The third (SALT) spectrum is  
similar to the second one but flux in red part has decreased by  
about 25%.  

Swift observed OGLE18wc for 2.0ks on 2018-02-21. The XRT detected  
an X-ray source with the net count rate of 0.013 +/-0.003 cts/s  
located 3.5"" (error radius is 5.8"") from the optical transient.  
Fixing the absorbing column density to the Galactic value in  
the direction of the source, n_H1 = 1.63x10^20 cm^-2 (Kalberla  
et al. 2005 A&A, 440, 775), the spectrum can be fit with  
the absorbed power law with the photon index of 2.15 +/-0.40 and  
the unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV flux of 4.3x10^-13 ergs/cm^2/s.  

An UV source is detected at the position of the transient  
with the following UVOT Vega magnitudes:  

Band   Mag. Err. 
UVW2  19.46 0.18 
UVM2  19.74 0.29 
UVW1  19.47 0.34 
U   19.18 0.31 
B  >19.86 
V   18.76 0.24 

The above magnitudes are not corrected for the Galactic reddening  
of E(B-V)=0.013 (Schlafly et al. 2011 ApJ, 737, 103) and are  
not host-subtracted.  

The Swift X-ray detection and blue UV colors together with  
the irregular lightcurve observed by OGLE-IV, WISE colors and  
archival VLBI detection suggest that OGLE18wc is a flaring blazar.  
The optical spectra of OGLE18wc resemble the spectrum of Mrk 501,  
a high-synchrotron peaked BL Lac type object that has a significant  
contribution from its host galaxy light in the optical band  
(Abdo et al. 2011, ApJ, 727, 129). OGLE18wc shows similarities  
to our spectra of the Fermi-detected transient  
ASASSN-17gs/AT2017egv (ATel #10642) recently identified as  
a radio-weak BL Lac by Bruni et al. (2018, ApJ, 854L, 23).  
We encourage the search for a GeV counterpart to OGLE18wc.

The optical transient OGLE18act = AT2018act was detected on  
2018-03-08 coinciding with an uncataloged galaxy visible at  
the stacked OGLE-IV image. The previous OGLE-IV observations show  
the transient slowly rising to I=19.2 since the first detection  
on 2018-01-21. 

We obtained the spectrum of OGLE18act on 2018-03-10 using the FOcal  
Reducer/low dispersion Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) on the Very Large  
Telescope (VLT). The spectrum reveals blue continuum with  
superimposed emission lines of the Balmer series, [O II],  
[O III] and faint [S II] at redshift z=0.078. Balmer emission lines  
have a very complex shape. An unresolved narrow emission peak (FWHM  
~<500 km/s) is superimposed on a broad component with an extended  
red wing (total width ~10000 km/s). There is a narrow absorption  
feature blue shifted by 700-800 km/s with respect to the narrow  
emission component.  

Swift observed OGLE18act for 4.1ks on 2018-03-14. The XRT detected  
no X-ray source at the position of the transient with an upper  
limit of 0.004 cts/s. Assuming power law emission with  
the photon index of 2 and HI column density of 3.07x10^20 cm^-2  
this translates to the unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV flux limit  
of 1.4x10^-13 ergs/cm^2/s.  

A faint ultraviolet source is detected at the position of  
the transient with the following UVOT magnitudes (Vega system, 
not corrected for the host galaxy light):  

JD        Band   Mag.  Err. 
2458192.21  UVW2  19.50  0.20 
2458192.00  UVW1  19.00  0.09 
2458192.20    U   18.65  0.22 
2458192.20    B   19.26  0.27 
2458192.21    V  >18.68 

Taking into account the Galactic reddening of E(B-V)=0.032  
(Schlafly et al. 2011 ApJ, 737, 103) these magnitudes suggest  
a black-body emission with the temperature ~9000 K (observer's  
frame). The low color temperature supports the classification  
of OGLE18act as a supernova. The VLT/FORS2 spectrum and OGLE-IV  
I-band lightcurve are similar to SN type IIn-P SN2011ht.

We report the VERITAS discovery of very-high-energy emission (VHE; >100
GeV) from the FRI radio galaxy 3C 264, also known as NGC 3862. Nearly 12
hours of quality selected data, collected by VERITAS between 09 February
2018 and 16 March 2018 (UTC), were analyzed. Preliminary results yield
an excess of 60 gamma-ray events above background at the position of the
source, corresponding to a statistical significance of 5.4 standard deviations.
Our preliminary flux estimate (E>300 GeV) is (1.3 &plusmn 0.2)e-12 cm^-2
s^-1, or approximately 1% of the Crab Nebula flux above the same threshold.
The Fermi-LAT 3FHL catalog (Ackermann et al. 2017 ApJS 232, 18) lists a
photon index of 1.65 &plusmn 0.33 for 3C 264 which, when extrapolated to
the VHE band, is consistent with the VERITAS detection. At a redshift of
0.0217, 3C 264 is a more distant analog to M87, with superluminal motion
of ~7c (Meyer et al. 2015, Nature 521, 495) detected in its kpc-scale optical
jet. With this discovery, 3C 264 is the most distant radio galaxy detected
at VHE so far. VERITAS will continue to observe 3C 264; multi-wavelength
observations are encouraged. Questions regarding the VERITAS observations

ATEL #11437,"		Hole, Transient

The new X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070/ASASSN-18ey (ATel #11399, #11400)
may be a bright and rapidly-rising hard state black hole binary in outburst
(ATel #11403, #11404, #11406, #11418, #11420, #11421, #11423, #11424, #11425,
#11426, #11427, #11432).

We observed the source with the fast triple-beam camera ULTRACAM (Dhillon
et al. 2007 378 825) at NTT/La Silla from UT 08:45 to UT 10:10 on 2018
March 16 in the SDSS u'g'i' filters. We used ULTRACAM's drift mode and
50 pixel windows to image at a frame rate of 72.5 Hz, with a mean deadtime
of 1.2 ms. The sky was photometric, with seeing ~1-2 arcseconds throughout.
The g' and i' lightcurves described here were extracted using optimal photometry
without bias or flat field corrections.

Dereddened median source mags are g'=12.03 and i'=12.24, calibrated against
a field comparison star observed simultaneously in a second ULTRACAM window,
and also corrected for Galactic extinction of A(g')=0.76 mag and A(i')=0.39
mag (Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011 ApJ 737 103). The comparison star is URAT1
486-270264 (Zacharias et al. 2015 ApJ 150 4) at RA=18h20m26.43s, Dec=+07d10m11.8s.

Illustrative light curve segments are shown at the link below. The observation
reveals spectacular flaring activity over a range of timescales. Strong
sub-second variations with some flares unresolved on the native cycle time
of ~13.8 ms are apparent (see also ATel #11426). As a prominent example,
the strongest i' flare peaks a factor of ~4.3 in flux (Delta mag ~1.6)
above the adjacent mean flux level, has a duration of only ~0.3 s and shows
clear shorter sub-structure. The median signal-to-noise per frame is 24
(i') and 19 (g'). 

The sub-second flaring is strongly red, with a maximum colour change (g'-i')
of ~1.24 mag above the median(g'-i') colour of ~ -0.20. There is a clear
trend of the source being redder when brighter (see link below). Power
spectra show that the variability is dominated by a strong and broad hump
spanning ~0.1-10 Hz and peaking just above 1 Hz, stronger in the red. There
is also evidence of a weaker high frequency component around ~20 Hz, and
possible quasi-periodicities at low frequencies between ~0.01-0.05 Hz.
The fractional rms variability amplitude (Vaughan et al. 2003 MNRAS 345
1271) is 0.22 and 0.12 in i' and g', respectively. 

These characteristics are strongly reminiscent of those seen in the hard
state of the black hole binary GX 339-4, which also showed red flaring
with a power spectral peak around 1 Hz in the optical and near-infrared
(Gandhi et al. 2010 MNRAS 407 2166, Casella et al. 2010 MNRAS 404 L21)
whose origin has been associated with compact jet activity. MAXI J1820+070
has recently displayed a bright radio counterpart consistent with the presence
of a jet (ATel #11420). These facts suggest that we are likely seeing optical
synchrotron activity in MAXI J1820+070 with a variability spectrum peaking
in the red. The short optical flaring timescales point to a compact emission
zone. 

The origin of these flares can be further tested by searching for sub-second
optical/infrared delays with respect to X-rays, and we encourage rapid
simultaneous multiwavelength observations to detect and monitor any evolution
in such delays (e.g. Gandhi et al. 2017 Nat. Astron. 1 859). Very few such
observations exist during outburst rise and the present bright outburst
presents an excellent opportunity in this regard.

ULTRACAM will attempt to observe the source at every opportunity over the
coming week, typically near the end of Chilean night (~08:30UT [or earlier]
into morning twilight). Anyone interested in coordination should contact
the authors, or sign up to SMARTNet (www.isdc.unige.ch/smartnet). PG thanks

ATEL #11438,"

The optical follow-up observations of FRB 180301 (Price et al., ATel #11376)
by GWAC_F60 telescope were made during 12:02:25 and 13:17:40 UT, Mar.
2, 2018, about 28.5 hours after the burst.  GWAC_F60 is a 60cm optical
telescope and is located at Xinglong observatory, China. This telescope
is operated by GuangXi university and National Astronomical Observatories,
CAS, and dedicated to observe the optical counterparts of short duration
astronomical transients, like GRB, FRB, GW. The weather was not good during
the observations.  Due to the small FoV of about 9 arcmin for GWAC-F60,
a mapping of 9 fields was applied in order to cover the whole 1 sigma error
circle of this burst. No any new source is detected in the stacked images.
The 5 sigma upper limit is estimated to be about R~16.7 mag, calibrated
by the USNO B1.0 R2 magnitude.

ATEL #11421,"
The transient MAXI J1820+070 (= ASASSN-18ey; ATel #11399, #11400) is an
outbursting low-mass X-ray binary in which the accreting object is suspected
to be a black hole (ATel #11418). Between approximately 8-11 UTC on 2018
March 15, I obtained unfiltered, time-series photometry of this object
with the 80-cm Sarah L. Krizmanich Telescope at the University of Notre
Dame in South Bend, Indiana (USA). Individual exposures were 2 seconds
long, with an overall cadence of 5 seconds per image. 

As shown in the light curve at the link below, the system displayed chaotic
variability during these observations. The top panel of the linked figure
shows the full light curve, while the bottom panel zooms in on a representative
30-minute segment so that individual points may be seen more clearly. The
source flickered almost constantly, undergoing many flares that lasted
for only a few seconds. A few exceptional flares were a half-magnitude
in amplitude, but the typical flare amplitude was 0.2-0.3 mag. The system's
average magnitude was approximately 13.0 (bandpass: unfiltered with a Johnson
V zeropoint). 

To confirm that the fast variability was not an artifact caused by scintillation
noise or seeing variations, I inspected light curves of several check stars
in the field, and even though they were considerably fainter than MAXI
J1820+070, they showed comparatively little scatter (RMS = 0.02 mag). 

Given that much of the observed variability occurred on timescales of less
than 5 seconds, it is important to utilize as rapid a cadence as possible
when obtaining time-series photometry of this object.

We report the MAXI/GSC detection of a new candidate superburst from GS
1826-238. 

The event from GS 1826-238 was found in MAXI/GSC observations on 2018 Feb
12 (MJD 58161). No superburst was observed from this source yet. The event
was detected at 18:34 UT and lasted for at least 3 hours (three scan transits
for MAXI) with a fast-rise and exponential-decay light curve. The spectrum
of each of the three scan transits is well fitted by an absorbed blackbody
model with temperatures kT = 1.8 (+/- 0.2), 1.5 (+/- 0.2) and 1.3 (+0.3,
-0.2) keV at 18:34, 20:07 and 21:39 UT, respectively. The hydrogen column
density was fixed at 0.28 x10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> (Ono et al 
2016, PASJ, 68, 14). The bolometric flux declined from 2.9 (+/- 0.4) x10<sup>-8</sup>
to 1.5 (+/- 0.3) x10<sup>-8</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> over the course
of 3 hours. The e-folding decay time is 4.3 (+5.5, -1.5) hours. Since these
results prove a long decay time of the burst (more than an hour) and cooling
along the decay, we conclude that this is the first superburst observed
from GS 1826-238.

ATEL #11424,"
On 2018 Mar 6, ASAS-SN discovered an optical transient toward the inner
galaxy. Subsequently MAXI J1820+070 was discovered as a new X-ray transient
(ATel #11399), and  D. Denisenko suggested the two transients were associated
(ATel #11400). Subsequent X-ray and optical observations strengthened this
association, and led to the conclusion that this source is likely a new
black hole X-ray binary (ATels #11406, #11418, 11420, 11421 , 11423). 

We obtained optical spectroscopy of this source on UT 2018 March 15.4 with
the Goodman Spectrograph on the SOAR telescope. We obtained both a low
resolution spectrum (wavelength range 3000-7000 A, resolution 5.6 A) and
a moderate resolution spectrum (5500-6750 A, resolution 1.7 A). The low
resolution spectrum shows strong, broad H-alpha emission and weaker emission
from He I 5875 and the Bowen blend. In the medium resolution spectrum,
the H-alpha has a FWHM of about 1150 km/s. It is asymmetric but not clearly
double-peaked, possibly due to the modest S/N of our spectrum. This FWHM
is relatively low for a black hole X-ray transient, suggesting either that
the system has a long period associated with an evolved donor or that it
is relatively face-on. There are no obvious absorption features in the
spectrum, indicating that continuum is dominated by the accretion disk.

The optical position of ASASSN-18ey/MAXI J1820+070 is consistent with a
star in archival data, and this star has a Gaia DR1 J2000 position of 18:20:21.9393,
+07:11:07.190, with a nominal astrometric uncertainty of a few milliarcseconds
per coordinate.

We obtained spectra of the new X-ray transient MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11399)
with the Keck I telescope and LRIS spectrograph on March 15.6 (UT). The
spectra have a resolution of 3 Ang and cover 3500 to 8000 Ang. The continuum
dominates the light, but low-equivalent-width emission features are also
seen. We confirm the presence of a broad, asymmetric H-alpha emission line
(ATel #11424). We also detect broad H-beta, H-gamma, and H-delta absorption
with emission lines in the center, characteristic of an accretion disk
in outburst. He II 4686 (with EW = -1.7 Ang) is seen on top of the continuum.
We also see deep Ca II interstellar absorption in the blue, suggesting
significant extinction along the line-of-sight. 

We thank Josh and Cynthia at the Keck Observatory for helping to obtain
these observations.

ATEL #11417,"
We carried out offline analysis of data from Astrosat CZTI in a 200 second
window centred on the FRB 180311 (Parkes discovery - Oslowski, S.  et al.,
ATEL #11396) trigger time, 2018-03-11 04:11:54.80 UTC, to look for any
coincident hard X-ray flash. CZTI is a coded aperture mask instrument that
has considerable effective area for about 29% of the entire sky, but is
also sensitive to brighter transients from the entire sky. At the instant
of the FRB, AstroSat was pointing at (RA = 189.2, DEC = 62.3): about 157
degrees away from the nominal FRB direction. 

CZTI data were de-trended to remove orbit-wise background variation. We
then searched data from the four independent, identical quadrants to look
for coincident spikes in the count rates. Searches were undertaken by binning
the data in 0.01s, 0.1s, and 1s respectively. Statistical fluctuations
in count rates were estimated by using data from 10 neighbouring orbits.
We selected confidence levels such that the probability of a false trigger
in this 200s window is 10^-4. We do not find any evidence for any hard
X-ray transient in this window, in the CZTI energy range of 20-200 keV.

We convert our count rates into fluence and flux limits by assuming that
the source spectrum is a power law with alpha = -1.0. We use a detailed
mass model of the satellite to calculate the instrument response in the
direction of FRB180311. We get the following upper limits for source fluence
and flux in the 20-200 keV band: <br /> 

0.01 s: Effective fluence limit= 7e-7 ergs/cm^2; flux= 7e-5 ergs/cm^2/s

CZTI data were de-trended to remove orbit-wise background variation. We

very noisy in this time interval. Searches were undertaken by binning the

in this window, in the CZTI energy range of 20-200 keV.

ATEL #11418,"
We report on optical observations of the newly discovered transient MAXI
J1820+070 (ATel #11399, #11400, #11403, #11404, #11406). We performed optical
(g', i') observations of the field with the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO)
1-m robotic telescope located at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory,
Chile, on March 13th, 2018 (MJD 58190.38) obtaining one 200-second integration
image of the field for each filter. The optical counterpart is clearly
detected with the following AB magnitudes: 

g'=13.14 +/- 0.03

i'=13.08 +/- 0.05

These values are not corrected for Galactic extinction (nH=1.12E21 cm^-2
in the direction of the source; Dickey & Lockman, 1990, ARAA, 28, 215;
Kalberla et al. 2005, A&A, 440, 775), that corresponds to Av=0.51 +/- 0.02
according to the NH/Av relation of Guver & Ozel 2009.

The calibration of the magnitudes was performed against a group of PanStarrs
bright stars in the field of the target. In the PanStarrs catalogue, moreover,
the magnitudes of a faint object at a position that is coincident with
that of the source are tabulated (g'=19.381 +/- 0.073, i'= 18.039 +/- 0.101).
This faint target is therefore likely to be the optical counterpart of
MAXI J1820+070 during quiescence. From this, we could infer the amplitude
of the outburst, that so far is 6.24 +/- 0.08 mag and 4.96 +/- 0.11 mag
in the g' and i' bands, respectively. According to the empirical relation
between outburst amplitude and orbital period for LMXBs (Shahbaz & Kuulkers
1998, MNRAS, 295, L1), this implies the orbital period is likely to be
< 11.6 hours.

Assuming the source is near the far side of this Galactic dust, we corrected
for the reddening (E(B-V)=0.163 +/- 0.007), and obtained the unabsorbed
optical fluxes per unit frequency. Considering the 2-10 keV unabsorbed
flux measured by MAXI on the same day (3.2839 +- 0.3893 E-9 erg/cm2/s),
we could place MAXI J1820+070 on the optical/X-ray correlation plot for
BH- and NS- X-ray binaries (Russell et al. 2006, MNRAS, 371, 1334; 2007,
MNRAS, 379, 1108), adopting various possible distances for the source (0.3,
1, 3, 8, 20 kpc); see link below. We find that MAXI J1820+070 lies in a
region of the diagram that is consistent with a black hole X-ray binary,
for any reasonable distance. Only for distances << 1 kpc could the optical/X/-ray
ratio be consistent with a typical neutron star X-ray binary. We can rule
out a high-mass X-ray binary due to the 6-mag amplitude of the outburst,
and the source is likely too X-ray bright to be an accreting white dwarf
(it is still rising according to the MAXI light curve). We therefore tentatively
claim that MAXI J1820+070 is a new black hole candidate low-mass X-ray
binary, although confirmation (ideally dynamical, which may be possible
in quiescence) will be required.

Further multiwavelength observations are strongly encouraged in order to
prove the nature of the source. The LCO observations are part of an on-going
<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/faulkesxrb"">monitoring campaign</a> of ~ 40
low-mass X-ray binaries (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2751"">Lewis
et al. 2008</a>) with LCO and the Faulkes Telescopes. This work makes use
of observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO).

The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
has observed enhanced gamma-ray flux and an unusually hard spectrum from
a source positionally consistent with the BL Lacertae object TXS 0505+056
also known as 3FGL J0509.4+0541 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23). This
source is also included in the 3FHL catalog (Ajello et al. 2017, ApJS,
232, 18, as 3FHL J0509.4+0542). Its coordinates are R.A.: 05h09m25.9644s,
Dec: 05d41m35.333s (J2000; Beasley et al. 2002, ApJS, 141, 13) and it has
a redshift z = 0.3365 (Paiano et al. 2018, ApJ, 854, 32). 

Preliminary analysis indicates that on 13 March 2018 this source was in
a high-flux state, with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (0.4+/-0.1)
X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only). This corresponds
to a flux increase of a factor of about 5.5 relative to the average flux
reported in the third Fermi LAT catalog (3FGL) and is the highest daily
averaged flux detected from this object. The corresponding photon spectral
index of 1.8+/-0.1 is significantly harder than the 3FGL value 2.04+/-0.03.
Some high energy (E > 10 GeV) photons have also been detected in the past
few days. 

This source lies in the error region of the extremely high-energy (EHE)
IceCube-170922A neutrino event (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/21916.gcn3,
ATel#10773, #10787) and the LAT detected a flaring state close to that
neutrino event (ATel#10791). 

Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring
of this source region will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity
of this source we encourage multiwavelength observations. For this source
the Fermi-LAT contact person is Sara Buson (sara.buson@gmail.com). 

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

We have observed the position of MAXI J1820+070 (ATel #11406) with the
Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA) at 15.5 GHz. Our observation
began on 14-Mar-2018/01:35:15.2 and had a total duration of 10.8 hours.
J1824+1044 and 3C 286 were used as the phase and absolute flux calibrator,
respectively. Date were reduced using the custom software pipeline 'reduce_dc'
(e.g. Davies et al. 2009) and further flagging and then interactive cleaning
were performed in CASA. 

We find an unresolved source at phase center, with an integrated flux
density of 15 +/- 1.5 mJy. The error reported here is a 10% calibration
error, which dominates any statistical uncertainty. The measured source
position is RA: 18:20:22, Dec: 07:11:10.7 and our clean beam has a major
and minor FWHM of 60"" and 30"" respectively. This is consistent with the
XRT position reported in ATel #11406. The nearest source in NVSS is around
200"" away.  

We plan on continued monitoring of this source and would like to thank
the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory staff for carrying out these observations.

any coincident hard X-ray flash. CZTI is a coded aperture mask instrument
that has considerable effective area for about 29% of the entire sky, but
is also sensitive to brighter transients from the entire sky. Based on
the pointing direction of Astrosat at the time of the GW event (RA = 189.2,
DEC = 62.3), the FRB was 157 degrees off axis. 

CZTI data were de-trended to remove orbit-wise background variation. We
then searched data from three independent, identical quadrants to look
for coincident spikes in the count rates. We ignored a quadrant which was
very noisy in this time interval. Searches were undertaken by binning the
data in 0.01s, 0.1s, and 1s respectively. Statistical fluctuations in count
rates were estimated by using data from 10 neighbouring orbits. We selected
confidence levels such that the probability of a false trigger in this
100s window is 10^-3. We do not find any evidence for any hard X-ray transient
in this window, in the CZTI energy range of 20-200 keV. 

We convert our count rates into fluence and flux limits by assuming that
the source spectrum is a power law with alpha = -1.0. We use a detailed
mass model of the satellite to calculate the instrument response in the
direction of FRB180301. We get the following upper limits for source fluence
and flux in the 20-200 keV band:<br/> 

0.01 s: Effective fluence limit= 1e-6 ergs/cm^2; flux= 1e-6 ergs/cm^2/s
<br/> 
0.1  s: Effective fluence limit= 5e-7 ergs/cm^2; flux= 5e-6 ergs/cm^2/s
<br/> 
1.0  s: Effective fluence limit= 2e-7 ergs/cm^2; flux= 2e-5 ergs/cm^2/s
<br/> 

CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including
VSSC, ISAC, IUCAA, SAC and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation
funded, managed and facilitated the project.

We here provide classifications for 8 hard X-ray sources listed as 'unknown
AGN' in the 105 month Swift/BAT all-sky survey catalogue (Oh et al. 2018,
ApJS, 235, 4).

The corresponding optical spectra were extracted from the 6dF Galaxy Survey
(Jones et al. 2009, MNRAS, 399, 683). They were classified using the criteria
of Veilleux & Osterbrock (1987, ApJS, 63, 295) and the line ratio diagnostics
of Ho et al. (1993, ApJ, 417, 63) and Kauffmann et al. (2003, MNRAS, 346,
1055); regarding the definition of subclasses for Seyfert 1 galaxies, the
H_beta/[O III] line flux ratio criterion described in Winkler (1992, MNRAS,
257, 667) was used.

If not indicated otherwise, the coordinates reported below are extracted
from the Simbad database.

AGILE is monitoring the gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula identifying
enhanced emission episodes such as ""flares"" and ""long-waves"" (see Striani
et al., ApJ 765, 2013). 

Integrating from 2018-03-11 04:00 UT to 2018-03-13 04:00 UT, AGILE/GRID
detects enhanced gamma-ray emission from a source positionally consistent
with the Crab Nebula. 

The total (pulsar + Nebula) gamma-ray flux is: F = (5.4 +/- 1.3) x 10^-6
ph cm^-2 s^-1 (E > 100 MeV). This flux level is consistent with the recent
ATel #11412 from Fermi/LAT, and is a factor of ~2 greater than the average
gamma-ray flux. 

This measurement was obtained with AGILE observing a large portion of the
sky in spinning mode. 

Multifrequency observations of the Crab are strongly encouraged.

We report on a new NIR flare of the low redshift quasar PKS0736+017 (z=0.189),
also known as CGRaBSJ0739+0137, associated with the gamma-ray source 2FGL0739.2+0138.
Our recent NIR photometry for this source shows that on march 7th,2018
(JD2458184.721088) the object brightness corresponded to J = 13.70 +/-
0.03, H = 12.81 +/- 0.05 and Ks = 11.942 +/- 0.04. These values are about
1 magnitude brighter than our previous photometry, obtained on JD2458086.002,
for this field. Hence it has more than doubled its flux in this lapse.
The object is brightest since we started monitoring it on JD 2455241. Our
observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro
Observatory operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics
and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera.
We strongly encourage further multiwavelength coverage.

We report the observations of nearby Type IIn supernova SN 2018zd, discovered
by Koichi Itagaki and classified by Zhang et al. (ATel #11379),  with the
X-ray Telescope (XRT) onboard Swift. Swift-XRT observed SN 2018zd between
2018 March 04 to March 11. We do not detect X-ray emission from the SN
position. For a total exposure of 18.37 ks, our 3-sigma upper limit on
the count rate is 1.03E-3 counts/s. For a Galactic column density of 7.37E20
cm^{-2} towards the SN direction and assuming a 10 keV thermal plasma,
this corresponds to an  (03.-10 keV) unabsorbed flux of 5.22E-14 erg/cm2/s
and an unabsorbed luminosity of ~1.1E39 erg/s (assuming a distance of ~13
Mpc).

In ATEL #11404 on MAXI J1820+070, there are some errors, which we correct
here. The decimal coordinates of the UVOT source should be: 

RA/Dec(J2000) = 275.09138, 7.1853 

The sexagesimal coordinates are correct. Also the optical counterpart should
have been named ASASSN-18ey, and the correct name of the MAXI source is
MAXI J1820+070. Apologies for these errors. 

Utilizing ground processed data, we calculate an updated XRT position for
this transient. The coordinates are RA/Dec(J2000) = 275.09118, 7.18563,

RA(J2000) =18h 20m 21.88s,  

Dec(J2000) = +07d 11m 08.3s),  

with an error radius of 1.5 arc-seconds (90% confidence), 1.4 arc-seconds
from the position of ASSASN-18ey (ATEL #11400). This updated position therefore
removes the discrepancy between the optical and X-ray position.

The nova candidate PNV J17140261-2849237 = TCP J17140253-2849233  
was discovered by H. Nishimura, T. Kojima, K. Nishiyama and  
F. Kabashima. A. Takao reports the transient (9.5mag) visible at  
unfiltered images obtained on 2018-03-10.753 UT. Spectroscopic  
observations with the 2m Liverpool Telescope confirmed  
the transient to be a Fe II type nova (ATel #11398).  

Swift observed the nova for 2.0ks on 2018-03-12.217, 35 hours after  
the first optical detection. The XRT found no X-ray source at  
the nova position with an upper limit of 0.002 cts/s. Assuming  
power law emission with the photon index of 2 and full Galactic HI  
column density in the source direction (2.45x10^21 cm^-2) this  
translates to the unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV flux limit  
of 1.3x10^-13 ergs/cm^2/s. 

The simultaneously obtained UVOT image is distorted by a tracking  
error preventing precision astrometry and photometry, but  
the bright (W2=13.03+/-0.02) ultraviolet source is clearly visible  
at the reported nova position.

OGLE-2018-NOVA-01, a recurrent nova explosion of Nova LMC 1996, erupted
on 2018 Feb 27.07770 UT, but was only discovered and announced on 2018
Mar 08. Observations by the Neil 
Gehrels Swift Observatory began shortly after, on 2018 Mar 09. 

UVOT grism data were collected on Mar 09 (day 10.7-10.8 after outburst).

The 2.6 ks exposure provides a spectrum that shows the presence of a 
broad Mg II 2800 &Aring;  emission line, and UV absorption features of
the 
iron curtain. The iron curtain lifts later in the UV than in the optical.

Due to the presence of this absorption and a noisy spectrum, only a rough
estimate of the FWZI of 10,000 km s<sup>-1</sup> for the Mg II line can
be 
made. 

The Swift-UVOT photometry between days 10.7 and 12.2 is given in the table
below. The central wavelengths for the UVOT filters are v ~ 5468 &Aring;,
b ~ 4392 &Aring;, u ~ 3465 &Aring;, uvw1 ~ 2600 &Aring;, uvm2 ~ 2246 &Aring;
and uvw2 ~ 1928 &Aring;. 
The UV and optical brightness faded by ~0.1-0.2 magnitudes in each filter
between days 10.7 and 12.2, with the exception of the v-band, where the
magnitude stayed constant.

Preliminary Fermi LAT analysis reveals enhanced gamma-ray activity from
the direction of the Crab Nebula. The daily-averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100
MeV) on 11 March 2018 from the direction of the Crab Nebula was (4.9 +/-
0.5) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1. This is a factor of ~2 greater than the average
gamma-ray flux of (2.71 +/- 0.02) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 reported in the
third Fermi-LAT source catalog (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23). The
flux values in the last two 6-hour periods of 11 March 2018 were ~ (6.0
+/- 1.0) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1. All fluxes given are the sums of the pulsar
and nebular emission, and with statistical uncertainties only. These are
the highest gamma-ray fluxes observed for the Crab since October 2016 (ATel
9588). 

Fermi will interrupt the currently planned observations and maximize the
coverage toward the Crab nebula for at least 350 ks. This source is one
of the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently a preliminary estimation
of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi LAT is publicly available
(http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/ ). We strongly
encourage further multifrequency observations of this region. For this
source the Fermi LAT contact person is Rolf Buehler (rolf.buehler@desy.de).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (Manchester et al. 2013) project monitors
pulse times of arrival for 24 millisecond pulsars in the Galaxy on a fortnightly
cadence using the multibeam receiver on the CSIRO 64-m Parkes Telescope.
During these observations we commensally search for fast radio bursts (FRBs)
using the BPSR backend and Heimdall algorithm (Barsdell et al.  2011).
We have now detected our third FRB during the commensal search since commencing
in June 2017. Astronomer’s Telegrams <a href=http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=11046
"">11046</a> and <a href=""http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=11385"">11385</a>
describe the discovery of the two previous bursts and the same setup was
used to discover the burst described below.  

On 2018-03-11 at 04:11:54.80 UTC (2018-03-11.17493981481), we detected
a burst with a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 11.5, at the dispersion measure
(DM) of 1575.6 pc cm^-3, in the field of the millisecond pulsar PSR J2129-5721
(DM = 31.58 pc cm^-3). The burst was detected in the beam 4 of the receiver,
which at the time was pointed at a position of (RA, DEC 21:31:33.42, -57:44:26.7).
The burst width (full width at half maximum) was 12 ms and the early estimate
of fluence is 2.4 Jy ms. We note that the location of the burst within
the telescope beam is highly uncertain (> 0.25 deg) at the moment; consequently,
the fluence measurement is biased low (Macquart & Ekers 2017). 

This position is approximately -43.7 degrees off of the galactic plane.
The galactic contribution is estimated to be 45.287 pc cm^-3 from the NE2001
model (Cordes & Lazio, 2001) and 32.06 from the YWM16 model  (Yao et al.
2017). Assuming host contribution to the DM of 100 pc cm<sup>-3</sup>,
we estimate the redshift to be about 2. 

No repetitions were seen during 103 minutes of a subsequent observation
of the same field down to S/N limit of 10, nor during 5 minutes preceding
the FRB 180311. Details of total amount of time on that field during the
PPTA programme will be published elsewhere. 

We encourage prompt follow-up with available facilities. 

Two plots of the burst can be found here: 
<a href=""http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~soslowski/FRB180311/"">http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~soslowski/FRB180311/</a>

We used the interface available at <a href=""http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/ymw16/"">http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/ymw16/</a>
to estimate the redshift.

We obtained a spectrum of the transient AT 2018adg (see <a href=""https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018adg"">TNS</a>)
with the SPRAT spectrograph (resolution R ~ 350; Piascik et al. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9147E..8HP"">2014</a>)
on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope (LT; Steele et al. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5489..679S"">2004</a>)
on 2018 Mar 11.13 UT.  

The spectrum is consistent with AT 2018adg being a Type Ic supernova around
peak brightness, at a redshift of z ~ 0.02 to 0.03, in agreement with the
host galaxy redshift of z = 0.022 (da Costa et al. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1998AJ....116....1D"">1998</a>).
Comparing the spectrum to templates via SNID (Blondin & Tonry <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...666.1024B"">2007</a>)
shows good matches to the Type Ic supernovae SN 2004aw and SN 1994I around
peak brightness. We note however that a possible match (although significantly
poorer than the Ic templates) can also be obtained for the peculiar Type
Ia supernova SN 2005hk. 

The host galaxy of AT 2018adg is part of C17 of the K2 mission, therefore
further follow-up is strongly encouraged.

The spectrum shows strong Balmer lines which exhibit P-Cygni profiles,
with the edge of the H&alpha; absorption component indicating a maximum
velocity of -1200 km/s. O I 7773 &Aring; is also seen with a P-Cygni profile.
We identify several Fe II lines, including those at 4584, 4924, 5018, 6148,
6248 and 6456 &Aring;. N I (7468, 7442, 7424 &Aring;) is seen mainly in
absorption, with two clear components, a lower velocity one with a minimum
at -400 km/s and one at -700 km/s. The Si II 6347 and 6371 &Aring; lines,
along with Mg II (4481 &Aring;), show a similar structure, as do a number
of the Fe II lines. 

This spectrum shows TCP J17140253-2849233 is a Galactic nova (Fe II type)
in the early stages of an eruption.

Following the report by T. Kawamuro et al. (ATel #11399), the error region
of MAXI/GSC X-ray transient source MAXI J1820+070 was observed with iTelescope.Net
T32 instrument (0.43-m f/6.8 reflector + CCD) in Siding Spring, Australia.
A series of unfiltered 60-sec exposures was taken at 17:47-18:12 UT on
2018 March 11 with the T32 field of view (0.72x0.72 degree) covering the
entire 90% confidence level uncertainty area. The combined images were
compared to the scanned DSS Red plates taken on 1950-07-10, 1993-05-27

As noted by S. Otero in <a href=""https://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&oid=608515"">AAVSO
VSX entry</a>, ASASSN-18ey is related to the faint ROSAT X-ray source 1RXS
J182022.9+071125 formally 23"" away with 21"" error circle. The source has
ROSAT flux of 0.0239+/-0.0108 cnts/s and hardness ratios HR1=0.71+/-0.39,
HR2=0.29+/-0.47 which are rather usual for cataclysmic variables. Outburst
amplitude from quiescent Gaia Gmag=17.8 is also typical for dwarf novae.
GALEX magnitudes FUV=20.53, NUV=19.73 are somewhat faint resulting in rather
large (FUV-W1) color index of 5.5-5.6 (WISE J182021.94+071107.2 has W1=14.76+/-0.04,
AllWISE J182021.94+071107.2 - W1=14.91+/-0.4). Objects with (FUV-W1) above
5-5.5 are normally considered to be extragalactic, but it will be shown
that some cataclysmic variables may have (FUV-W1) value larger than 8 magnitudes.
J-K=0.75 and W1-W2=0.33 values are also telling in favor of the stellar
origin. 

ASASSN-18ey is showing variability on DSS plates, being brighter on POSS-I
Blue and Red images. Animation of 1950 and 1993 DSS Red plates against

The new large amplitude variable star in Centaurus at R.A. = 12 48 50.8,
Decl. = -41 26 54 (J2000.0) was discovered by Ivan Larin on the images
obtained remotely from iTelescope.Net T31 instrument (0.50-m f/6.8 reflector
+ CCD + f/4.5 focal reducer) in Siding Spring, Australia. The star was
near the detection limit (magnitude about 19.2) on the unfiltered 60-sec
exposure taken at 17:00 UT on 2018 February 21, but became as bright as
16.5m on March 10 images between 15:07 and 15:10 UT. The variable was named
Larin 2 (the second discovery by the 13-year old school student). Animation
of discovery images from T31 is posted at http://scan.sai.msu.ru/~denis/Larin2-T31-anim.gif

The new variable displays some peculiar properties that have caused the
special attention. Despite the deep fading on 2018 Feb. 21 image, the eight
years long Siding Spring Survey <a href=""http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/getcssconedb_id.cgi?ID=3041074035425&OUT=csv&SHORT=short&PLOT=plot"">light
curve</a> from CRTS (A. Drake et al., 2009) shows no eclipses on 256 epochs.
The variable in SSS data is always in the 17.0-17.8 range, except for two
outliers with large errors and one spurious detection at 15.8m. Then, the
star has a huge color index between the ultraviolet and infrared bands:

(FUV-W1)=8.3
. It has an UV counterpart GALEX J124850.7-412654 with magnitudes FUV=21.31+/-0.35,
NUV=21.42+/-0.47 and IR source WISE J124850.79-412654.5 (W1=13.008+/-0.025,
W2=12.515+/-0.025, W3=11.486+/-0.128, W4=8.933+/-0.324). Near-infrared
color index (J-K) is also very large for cataclysmic variables: 14.23-13.25=1.0
(2MASS) and 14.40-13.14=1.26 (DENIS). The object has an X-ray counterpart
in XMM-Newton and Chandra catalogs: 3XMM J124850.8-412653 (flux=5.96e-15
mW/m2) and CXO J124850.796-412654.17 which shows the flux variation by
a factor of 12, from 9.8e-16 mW/m2 to 1.1e-14 mW/m2. 

The follow-up observations were performed remotely at the Chilescope Observatory
in Chilean Andes near La Serena. 0.50-m f/3.6 Newtonian reflector with
4Kx4K FLI Proline CCD providing the 66'x66' field of view was used. A total
of sixty-three 180-sec exposures in Luminance filter were obtained from
05:02 to 08:39 UT on 2018 March 11 with the short interruption from 06:45
to 07:04 UT. The light curve is presented <a href=""http://scan.sai.msu.ru/~denis/Larin2-Chilescope-LC-20180310.gif"">here</a>.
The star 1.6' to the East of the variable was used as a reference star
with V=16.046 in APASS DR9 (A. Henden et al., 2016). The variable shows
no deep eclipses over 3.6 hours (unless it was missed during the 20-minute
gap), suggesting the orbital period is larger than 4 hours. Otherwise the
light curve is characterized by the short scale variability with a period
about 0.0362(2)d, or 52.1 minute which can be interpreted as a rotation
period of the white dwarf. The search for the possible period in Siding
Spring Survey data is giving low significance peaks near 0.25357d (6.1
hr) and 0.23748d (5.7 hr). 

Based on the variability of X-ray counterpart and the complicated optical
light curve with no stable pattern, Larin 2 is likely a magnetic cataclysmic
variable star (polar) with a large IR contribution from the secondary and
a long period. Photometric time series from multiple longitudes are needed
to determine the orbital period of this variable star. Spectroscopy is
also encouraged to verify the proposed classification as an intermediate
polar. Color-combined DSS finder chart is uploaded to http://scan.sai.msu.ru/~denis/Larin2-BRIR.jpg
(10'x10' FOV).

This is reposted from GCN #22471 as it is of interest to the transient
community. 

At 00:11:39 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and 
located MAXI J1820+070 (Kawamuro et al, 2018; ATel #11399)  
(trigger=813771, retriggering as trigger=813772).   
Swift slewed immediately to the location. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is  
RA, Dec 275.025, +7.192 which is  

RA(J2000) = 18h 20m 06s 

Dec(J2000) = +07d 11' 33"" 

with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including  
systematic uncertainty).  Because of the of duration of this 
image trigger (17 minutes) no BAT lightcurve is immediately available.

The XRT began observing the field at 00:31:42.2 UT, 1202.8 seconds 
after the BAT trigger. XRT found a bright X-ray source located at RA, 
Dec 275.0895, 7.1832 which is equivalent to: 

RA(J2000)  = +18h 20m 21.48s 

Dec(J2000) = +07d 10' 59.5"" 

with an uncertainty of 5.3 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This 
location is 232 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position. This position

is 33.1 arcseconds from that of a known X-ray source: 1RXS 
J182022.9+071125 in the ROSAT RASSFSC catalogue. Assuming a typical GRB

power-law spectrum (NH=3e21 cm^-2, gamma=2), the catalogue entry for 
this object  is equivalent to a 0.2-10 keV flux of 9.3e-13 erg cm^-2 
s^-1; the flux in the  2.5 s XRT image was 1.37e-09 erg cm^-2 s^-1. No

event data are yet available to determine the column density using X-ray

spectroscopy. 

UVOT took a finding chart exposure of 150 seconds with the White 
filter starting 1212 seconds after the BAT trigger. There is a  
16.8 mag source at  

RA(J2000) = 18:20:21.25 = 275.08856 

DEC(J2000) = 07:10:54.7 = 7.18186 

with a 90%-confidence error radius of about 0.61 arc seconds. 
This position is 5.9 arc seconds from the center of the XRT position. 

No correction has been made for the expected extinction 
corresponding to E(B-V) of 0.23. 

The XRT and UVOT locations of the counterpart are near the location  
of ASASSN-18ey (distances=10.5 arcsec, 16 arcsec respectively),  
which was suggested as the counterpart to the MAXI source by  
Denisenko (ATel #11400). 

"
ATEL #11404,"
In ATEL #11403 the UVOT counterpart reported was incorrect, and was in
fact 
an unrelated star near the XRT position. In the UVOT prompt white image
we 
detect a bright source, which has considerable brightening over archival

images of the field, at the following coordinates, RA/Dec(J2000) = 75.09138,

7.1853, which is equivalent to: 

RA(J2000) =  18h 20m 21.93s, 

Dec(J2000) = +07d 11m 07.1s 

This source lies 0.36 arc-seconds from the source ASASSN-18el (ATEL #11400),

and is therefore the same source. 

We note that the XRT position is 10.5 arc-seconds from the UVOT/ASASSN

position, however, given the brightness of the XRT source, we believe it
is 
the same object as MAXI J1820-070 and the associated ASASSN-18el. 

We apologize any confusion.

The MAXI/GSC nova alert system triggered on a bright uncatalogued X-ray
transient source at 12:50 UT on 2018 March 11. Using GSC camera GSC_2 and
GSC_7 data of 5 scan transits from 2018-03-11 19:48 to 2018-03-12 02:04,
we obtain the source position at

(R.A., Dec) = (275.112 deg, 7.037 deg) = (18 20 26, +07 02 13) (J2000)

with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short
radii of 0.47 deg and 0.38 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long
axis from the north direction is 28.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an
additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius).
The X-ray flux averaged over the scan was 32 +- 9 mCrab (4.0-10.0keV, 1
sigma error).

Since there is no known X-ray source in the error region, we tentatively
name the source MAXI J1820+070.

Follow-up observations are encouraged.

We report the spectroscopic classifications for the two transients SN 2018aca(=ASASSN-18ew)(ATel#11391)
and SN 2018acj,discovered by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae
(ASAS-SN) and XOSS, respectively. Their spectra were obtained on UT 2018
03 09.7 and UT 2018 03 09.8 with the Xinglong 2.16-m telescope (+BFOSC)
at Xinglong Observatory of NAOC. Based on the spectral fit with the spectral
comparison tools SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), the details
of our classification are given as:   

<br/> 
<br/> 
(1) The spectrum of SN 2018aca(=ASASSN-18ew) matches with the normal type
Ia supernova SN 1998aq at t = +5 days relative to the maximum light. Given
a redshift of 0.0435 for its host galaxy, an expansion velocity of about
11700 km/s can be deduced from the Si II 635.5 absorption minimum. This
classification spectrum is also posted on the IAU Transient Name Sever:
https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018aca 
<br/> 
(2) The spectrum of SN 2018acj (=PSP18B) matches with the type IIP supernova
SN 1999em at t = -1 days from the maximum light. Given a redshift of 0.0078
for its host galaxy UGC 8733, an expansion 
velocity of about 6000 km/s can be deduced from the Ha absorption minimum,
which sugggests that SN 2018acj belongs to the slow-velocity subclass of
SNe IIP. This classification spectrum is also posted on the IAU Transient

We report a new X-ray source, XMMSL2 J140446.9-251135, found in an 
XMM-Newton slew of 15/2/2018 with a count rate of 3.4 c/s (0.2-2 keV) in
the EPIC-pn 
camera, medium filter. 

A crude spectral fit gives a power-law of slope 4.8+/-1.2 or black-body
with 
kT=90+/-30 eV absorbed by the Galactic column. 
The absorbed flux for the black-body model is 4.6+/-1.5 E-12 ergs/s/cm2

with an unabsorbed flux of 1.2+/-0.4 E-11 ergs/s/cm2. 
This is at least a 
factor 15 higher than an upper limit from the ROSAT all-sky survey. 

The source position is RA:211.1955 DEC:-25.1931 with an error circle of

8 arcseconds (1-sigma). 

A follow-up by Swift-XRT on 28/2/2018 refined the coordinates to 
RA:211.1939 DEC: -25.1950 (error radius=3.6"", 90% confidence) 
consistent with the galaxy 
2MASX 14044671-2511433, which appears to be a normal galaxy from its 
WISE colours. The Swift count rate was 0.087+/-0.006 c/s indicating a reduction

in flux of a factor ~2, with a very soft spectrum of power-law of slope

6.0+/-0.3 or black-body with kT=70.3+/-6.0 eV. 

We interpret this as a possible tidal disruption event. 
Additional X-ray, optical, and radio observations have been triggered.

ATEL #11386,"
On March 1 at T0 = 07:34:19.76 (UTC), a Fast Radio Burst (FRB180301) was
detected during Breakthrough Listen observations with the 21-cm multibeam
receiver of the CSIRO Parkes radio telescope (see ATel #11376). 

FRB180301 occurred at an angle of 15.6 deg from the INTEGRAL pointing axis
at the time of the event, only 0.5 deg from the edge of the IBIS/ISGRI
Field of View (FoV). Unfortunately, at this orientation it is not possible
to exploit direct coded-mask imaging with IBIS/ISGRI (nor with JEM-X).

We searched the rates of the INTEGRAL ""all-sky detectors"" (see Savchenko
et al. 2017, A&A 603, A46) for any impulsive transients at the time of
the FRB. For the given FRB source location, the best sensitivity is achieved
with IBIS/ISGRI or SPI-ACS, depending on the source spectrum. The background
within +/-300 seconds around the event was very stable. We do not detect
any significant counterparts. 

We estimate a 3-sigma upper limit on the 75-2000 keV fluence of 4.0e-7
erg/cm^2 for a burst lasting less than 1 s with a characteristic short
GRB spectrum (an exponentially cut-off power-law with alpha=-0.5 and Ep=600
keV) occurring at any time in the interval within 300 s around T0. For
a typical long GRB spectrum (Band function with alpha=-1, beta=-2.5, and
Ep=300 keV), the derived fluence upper limit in 8 s is 1.1e-6 erg/cm^2
in the 75-2000 keV energy range. 

FRB180301 was in the FoV of IBIS/ISGRI in the pointings immediately before
and after the event. This allows us to derive the following upper limits
from these data: 

Before the event (UTC 2018-03-01 06:15:33 - 07:11:07): 

20 - 40 keV :   290 mCrab or 2.2e-9 erg/cm2/s 

40 - 80 keV :   453 mCrab or 3.3e-9 erg/cm2/s 

After the event (UTC 2018-03-01 08:11:03 - 09:06:37): 

20 - 40 keV :    88 mCrab or 6.8e-10 erg/cm2/s 

40 - 80 keV :   146 mCrab or 1.0e-9 erg/cm2/s

A very high signal-to-noise fast radio burst has been detected at the Parkes
Telescope on 2018-03-09 at 02:49:32.99 UTC (ATeL #11385). The INTEGRAL
observatory was taking data on a field centered at RA=87.04, Dec=19.32,
130 degrees from the approximate FRB arrival direction (RA=321.2 Dec=-33.8).
This orientation is not very favorable for a detection of any gamma-ray
transient with INTEGRAL all-sky detectors (see <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...603A..46S"">Savchenko
et al., 2017, A&A 603, A46</a> for details). The best constraints can be
achieved using the anti-coincidence shields of the spectrometer (SPI-ACS)
or the imager (IBIS/Veto). We inspected these data, which have a stable
background within the hour around the FRB occurrence time, and derive an
upper limit on any associated impulsive gamma-ray transient. 

We estimate a 3-sigma upper limit on the 75-2000 keV fluence of 5.7e-7
erg/cm<sup>2</sup> for a burst lasting less than 1 s with a characteristic
short GRB spectrum (an exponentially cut-off power-law with alpha=-0.5
and Ep=600 keV) occurring at any time in the interval within 300 s around

(1) The spectrum of ASASSN-18ew matches that of a normal Type Ia SN at
about the B-band maximum light. 
The expansion velocity of the SN ejecta, as inferred from the position
of the minimum of the Si II 635.5 nm line, is about  
11000 km/s. The redshift of the host galaxy, SDSS J102250.88+140316.5 is

(2) The spectrum of ATLAS18mit resembles that of the Type Ia SN 1998bu
at -2 days from the maximum light. 
The expansion velocity of the SN ejecta, as inferred from the position
of the minimum of the Si II 635.5 nm line, is about  
10700 km/s. The redshift of the host galaxy, LCRS B101737.6-062228, is

ATEL #11390,"
This nova was reported on 2018 March 8 by P. Mroz for the OGLE team in
ATel #11384. 
They identified it as probably a second eruption on N LMC 1996, which would
make this 
a recurrent nova. 

We obtained a spectrum starting at 01:58 UT on 2018 March 9 (JD 2458186.582)
with 
the Chiron echelle spectrograph on the SMARTS 1.5m at CTIO. 
The 900 second integration was taken in fiber mode (R=27,800; 4080-8900A).

The spectrum is that of an optically-thin He-N nova. The H&alpha; line

has a tripartite shape, with FWZI ~ &plusmn;3500 km/s. The shoulders terminate
at 
velocities of &plusmn;2700 km/s. The central emission core is 2800 km/s
wide, 
with narrow peaks at 0 and &plusmn;750 km/s (all velocities in the rest
frame of the LMC).  

The spectrum is noisy due to the rapid fading of the nova.  
Other emission lines include H&beta;, He I &lambda;&lambda;5876, 6678,
and the Bowen line 
complex. There may be a narrow He II &lambda;4686 emission line (FWHM ~
300 km/s). 

I thank Rodrigo Hinojosa, Leonardo Parades, and Todd Henry for their yeoman

efforts in scheduling the observation, and taking and delivering the data

in a timely fashion. 
Studies of novae at Stony Brook University are supported in part by an
NSF 
grant, and in part by research support from Stony Brook University. Data
will eventually be posted to the Stony Brook/SMARTS Nova Atlas.

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient.

ASAS-SN monitoring of the LMC provides a <a href= ""http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~assassin/followup/OGLE-2018-NOVA-01.png"">high-quality
light curve</a> of the newly discovered recurrent nova OGLE-2018-NOVA-01

and was undetected before 2018 Feb 25 (V > 16.3 mag).  On 2018 Feb 25.16,
it was observed to be in outburst, with V = 11.0 mag. The light curve has
since declined, and shows possibly-periodic modulation superimposed on
this decline.

The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (<a href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2013PASA...30...17M"">Manchester
et al. 2013</a>) project monitors pulse times of arrival for 24 millisecond
pulsars in the Galaxy on a fortnightly cadence using the multibeam receiver
on the CSIRO 64-m Parkes Telescope. During these observations we commensally
search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) using the BPSR backend and Heimdall
algorithm (<a href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2012ASPC..461...37B/"">Barsdell
et al.  2011</a>). We have now detected our second FRB during the commensal
search since commencing in June 2017. <a href=”http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=11046”>Astronomer’s
Telegram 11046</a> describes the discovery of our first burst and the same
setup was used to discover the burst described below.  

On 2018-03-09 at 02:49:32.99 UTC (2018-03-09.1177429398), we detected a
burst with a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 411, at the dispersion measure
(DM) of 263.47 pc cm^-3, in the field of the millisecond pulsar PSR J2124-3358
(DM = 4.60). The burst was detected in the centre beam of the receiver,
which at the time was pointed at a position of (RA, DEC 21:24:43.8, -33:58:44.5).
The burst width (full width at half maximum) was 0.576 ms and the early
estimate of fluence is 12 Jy ms. We note that the location of the burst
within the telescope beam is highly uncertain (> 0.25 deg) at the moment;
consequently, the fluence measurement is biased low (<a href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017arXiv171011493M/"">Macquart
& Ekers 2017</a>). In this case the estimate of fluence is less reliable
due to the dynamic range of recorded data not being sufficient and some
samples overflowing (see plots). We will provide a better localisation
in a separate telegram as soon as it becomes available. 

This position is approximately -45.44 degrees off of the galactic plane.
The galactic contribution is estimated to be 44.69 pc cm^-3 from the NE2001
model (<a href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2002astro.ph..7156C/"">Cordes
& Lazio, 2001</a>) and 29.97 from the YWM16 model  (<a href=""https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017ApJ...835...29Y/"">Yao
et al. 2017</a>). Assuming the latter model and the host contribution to
the DM of 100 pc cm<sup>-3</sup>, we estimate the redshift to be 0.187.

No repetitions were seen during 64 minutes of a subsequent observation
of the same field down to S/N limit of 10, nor during 31 minutes preceding
the FRB 180309. Details of total amount of time on that field during the
PPTA programme will be published elsewhere. 

We encourage prompt follow-up with available facilities. We note that the
event occurred too close to the Sun for an immediate follow-up with the
SWIFT satellite. 

We used the interface available at http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/ymw16/
to estimate the redshift.

Just after end of the invisibility period of Aql X-1 we had started photometrical
observations of this object in R passband. All data were taken using by
the CCD-photometer of 1-meter Zeiss-1000 telescope of Special Astrophysical
Observatory of Rus.Ac.Sci. 
Despite on inconvenient observations conditions (object airmass was about
2.0) we have measured brightness of Aql X-1 within three nights in February-March
on the twilight sky. As the atmospheric 
conditions were mediocre we observed it only in R-passband. Results of
preliminary data reduction are 
presented in the table. We can conclude that this transient is passing
now it's peak phase and probably should begin the fading stage. Relatively
large errors are explaining by high background level and 3-4 arcsec. atmospheric
seeing. More precise data are in preparation. Further observations at all
wavelengths are encouraged.

We report the discovery of a possible classical nova located toward the
Large Magellanic Cloud in data from the <a href=""http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/"">OGLE-IV
Survey</a>. 

The nova is located at (RA, DEC) = (05:13:32.71, -68:38:00.4) J2000.0.
It was discovered in the image acquired on 2018 Feb 27.07770 UT at an I-band
magnitude of 11.5. The last pre-eruption image was taken four days earlier
(on 2018 Feb 23.08035 UT), when the star had normal quiescent brightness
of about 19.5 mag. There was not any minor planet at this place. 

The progenitor was clearly visible in the OGLE images. It had the mean
magnitude of I = 19.73 mag and color (V-I) = 0.57 mag. It showed eclipsing-like
variability with a period of 2.84995 +/- 0.00003 d.  

The star is located 15 arcsec from the reported position of <a href=""http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~m31novae/opt/lmc/LMC_table.html"">Nova
LMC 1996</a>, within the uncertainty of the Nova LMC 1996 position. It
is probably the second recorded eruption of this object.

ATEL #11381,"
We report the discovery of two nova candidates in M31 on 3x300sec co-added
R-band CCD images taken with the 50/70cm Schmidt telescope at NAO Rozhen,
Bulgaria. 

The first nova candidate is located at RA(2000) = 0h43m44s.10, Dec(2000)
= +41o37'23"".08, which is 674"".0 east and 1274"".6 north of the center of
M31. 
Available R-band magnitude on 2018 03 07.746 UT - 17.46 +/- 0.03. 

The second nova candidate is located at RA(2000) = 0h45m21s.33, Dec(2000)
= +41o12'28"".66, which is 1770"".2 east and 219"".9 south of the center of
M31. 
Available R-band magnitude on 2018 03 07.746 UT - 19.29 +/- 0.10.

The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of the two instruments on the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope, has observed an increasing gamma-ray flux from
a source positionally consistent with the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ)
PKS 1004-217 (3FGL J1006.7-2159) with coordinates RA: 10h06m46.4136s, DEC:
-21d59m20.410s, J2000 (Beasley et al. 2002, ApJS, 141, 13) and redshift
z=0.331 (Hewitt & Burbidge 1989, ApJS, 69, 1). 

Preliminary analysis indicates that on 4 March 2018, this source was in
a high-flux state with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (0.84+/-0.08)
X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainties only). 
This value is about a factor of 19 greater than the average flux reported
in the third Fermi LAT catalog (3FGL; Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23)
and about twice as large as our last reported flare in ATel #10952. 
The corresponding photon spectral index of 2.33+/-0.07 is in the typical
range for a Fermi blazar. 
On 4 March 2018, between  00:00:00 / 06:00:00 UTC, this source underwent
a flare with a six-hour averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (1.2+/-0.3)
X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainties only) and a spectral
index of 1.94+/-0.18. 
Within this time, the six-hour averaged gamma-ray flux was about a factor
of 33 greater than the average flux reported in the 3FGL. 

Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring
of this source will continue.  
This source is being added to the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently
a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi-LAT
will be publicly available (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/).
In consideration of the ongoing activity of this source we strongly encourage
multiwavelength observations. For this source the Fermi LAT contact person
is Janeth Valverde (valverde@llr.in2p3.fr). 

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

ATEL #11379,"
We report an optical spectrum (range 350-900nm) of SN 2018zd, discovered
by Koichi Itagaki, that was obtained on UT Mar. 5.7 2018 with the 2.4-m
telescope (+YFOSC) at LiJiang Observatory of Yunnan Observatories.  This
spectrum is consistent with a type IIn supernova at relatively early phase.
The strong Na ID absorption (~4.2 angstrom) feature in the spectra indicates
that it suffered significant reddening due to MW or host galaxy. Cross-correlation
with a library of supernova spectra using the comparison tool SNID ((Blondin
and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 1998s at
t = -13 days.

ATEL #11377,"
We report the detection of X-rays from Nova Mus 2018 with the Swift XRT
instrument. We have been carrying out weekly monitoring of the nova with
Swift since its discovery on 2018 Jan 15 (see ATel #11220), and observations
up to 2018 Feb 24 yielded X-ray non-detections.  In the most recent observation
carried out on 2018 Feb 27 (net exposure time of 2460 seconds), 57 photons
are detected within a 20 pixel radius circle centered on the position of
the nova. After background subtraction and correcting for PSF losses, the
resulting net count-rate in the 0.3-10 keV energy range is 0.032 +/- 0.004
cts/s.

We extracted a spectrum of the nova and attempted to model it in Xspec
as an absorbed thermal plasma (tbabs*apec), but no stable fit to the data
was obtained. This is probably due to the low number of source counts.
The majority of the detected photons have energies in the range 4-7 keV,
indicating that the X-ray emitting region is highly absorbed (at least
5 x 10^22 cm^-2).

This first X-ray detection coincides with a likely dust formation event,
as indicated by the precipitous drop in optical brightness since 2018 Feb
20 (see the website linked in ATel #11298).  Prompted by this recent reduction
in optical brightness, we began obtaining UV grism spectroscopy of Nova
Mus 2018 with the Swift UVOT instrument.  Our first UV spectrum was taken
on 2018 Feb 17 and our most recent on 2018 Feb 27. The UV spectrum shows
a strong Mg II emission line, a weak C III 1909 line, and weak lines of
He II. There are significant absorption features in the range 190-300 nm,
most prominently at 210, 230, and 270 nm which become less deep between
the first and second spectra. Similar features were seen during the dust
minimum of V5668 Sgr.

UVOT photometry was initially obtained from the readout streak (formed
when sources are bright enough to saturate the detector) and most recently
using aperture photometry. The uvw2 and uvm2 images show a steady decline
until 2018 Feb 24 when the magnitudes (Vega) were uvw2 = 11.49 +/- 0.04,
uvm2 = 11.97 +/- 0.04. On 2018 Feb 27 the nova had suddenly decreased to
uvw2 = 13.37 +/- 0.04 and uvm2 = 13.53 +/- 0.04, similar to the large drop
observed in the optical and also due to the formation of dust. 

Nova Mus has now been detected at every wavelength, from radio to gamma-rays
(see ATels #11183, #11201, #11221, and #11296). We will continue to monitor
the nova with Swift over the coming weeks; observations at other wavelengths
are highly encouraged.

ATEL #11371,"
We report the discovery of DLT18i/AT 2018yu, which was found on 2018 March
1.0 (UT) at r~17.6 mag during the ongoing D<40 Mpc (DLT40) supernova search,
using data from the PROMPT5 0.41m telescope located at CTIO.  An image
with an identical PROMPT telescope at Meckering Observatory, Australia
shows the supernova to be present at low significance on Feb 28.6 UT, with
r~17.9 mag, with no detection at the same observatory on Feb 27.6.  DLT18i
is located at RA: 05:22:32.36 DEC: -11:29:13.8, northwest of the host galaxy
NGC 1888 (D=24 Mpc). All images were taken in a 'Clear' filter which was
calibrated to an approximate r-band magnitude using the USNO-B1 catalog.

The DLT40 survey has moved to an effective 12 hour cadence by utilizing
two PROMPT telescopes -- one at CTIO and the other at Meckering Observatory
in Western Australia -- and these are the first results reporting using
the combined effort.  Further observations are encouraged.

We performed H-alpha spectroscopic observations of the Be/X-ray binary
X Per, 
optical counterpart of the slow X-ray pulsar 4U 0352+30, using the 2.0m
telescope of the Rozhen National Astronomical Observatory,  
Bulgaria and the 1.2m TIGRE telescope located in Mexico.

Some of the measured equivalent widths (EW(Ha)) of the H-alpha emission
line are:

JD 2457383.34   -33.02&#8491;

JD 2457418.30   -30.28&#8491;

JD 2457654.57   -29.80&#8491;

JD 2457694.54   -33.28&#8491;

JD 2457734.38   -30.88&#8491;

JD 2457830.29   -31.87&#8491;

JD 2458095.22   -24.11&#8491;

JD 2458110.54   -22.35&#8491;

JD 2458120.23   -20.53&#8491;

JD 2458145.22   -18.44&#8491;

Combining the X-rays MAXI data (Matsuoka, M. et al., 2009, PASJ, 61, 999),

H-alpha data by Reig et al.(2016, A&A 590, A122) and our data, we find
that:

(1) there is a clear similarity between the variability of EW(Ha) and 2-10
keV X-ray flux;

(2) the recent decrease of X-ray flux is accompanied with decrease of 

EW(Ha) from above 30 &#8491; (March 2017) to 18 &#8491; (February 2018).

On Fig.1 are plotted the EW(Ha) and 2-10 keV X-ray flux (1 day light curve,
each 10 observations averaged).

Most probably during the last orbital period the X-ray pulsar severely
truncated the outer parts of the circumstellar  
disc.

Further multiwavelength observations of this source are needed to  
explore the geometry and the emission processes in this system.

ATEL #11374,"
We obtained an optical spectrum (range 350-900 nm) of DLT18i (=SN 2018yu,
ATEL#11371), discovered by the D<40 Mpc (DLT40) supernova search, on UT
Mar. 1.51 2018 with the 2.4 m telescope (+YFOSC) at the LiJiang Observatory
of YNAO. The spectrum is consistent with a young type-Ia supernova at a
few days before the maximum. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova
spectra using the GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A.Ap. 488, 383; https://gelato.tng.iac.es)
shows that 2018yu matches with SN 2003kf at 8 days before maximum light.
Adopting for the host galaxy (NGC 1888) a recession velocity of 2432 km/s,
we measure the velocity of the Si II 635.5-nm absorption feature to be
about 15000 km/s, and the velocity of Ca II H&K and NIR triplet absorptions
to be about 24000 km/s. A notch at the redder winger of Si II 6355 might
be contributed to the absorption of CII 6580 at a velocity about 14000
km/s. However, it is not certain for the detection of C II 6580 due to
the low signal noise ratio at this region.  
The classification spectrum is also posted on the IAU Transient Name Sever:

We report on preliminary analysis of an AstroSat observation of the newly
discovered X-ray transient, Swift J1658.2-4242 [J1658] (GCN #22416, #22417,
#22419; ATel #11306, #11307, #11310, #11311, #11318, #11321, #11336). The
observation of J1658 was performed between 2018-02-20 18:21:45 UT and 2018-02-21
04:25:38 UT, covering 7 satellite orbits, for a total of 20 ks exposure.
We analyzed the data from the LAXPC instrument, covering the energy range
3-80 keV (Antia et al. 2017 ApJS 231 10).

Power density spectra show the presence of band-limited noise plus a strong
(rms of ~16%) and sharp Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO), whose centroid
frequency increased with time from ~1.6 to 2 Hz. The total 0.1-20 Hz fractional
rms is ~34% over 3-80 keV. The presence of such a QPO indicates that the
source was in the hard intermediate state during these observations. The
power density spectrum combined from all three LAXPC cameras is shown at
the link below.

Spectral fitting was performed over the energy range of 4-60 keV for the
cameras LAXPC10 and 20, with LAXPC30 excluded due to a suspected gas leak
leading to loss of efficiency. The continuum spectra can be approximately
described by an absorbed disk blackbody and cutoff power law. A systematic
error of 4% was included while performing spectral fitting. We obtained
an N(H) = 1.6(+/-0.2)x10^{23} cm^{-2} (consistent with a NuSTAR observation
carried out ~4 days prior to ours; ATel #11321), an inner disk temperature
of 1.4+/-0.1 keV, a power law photon index of 1.76+/-0.06 and a high-energy
cutoff of 46+/-3 keV.  We obtained a reduced Chi^2 = 0.82 for 292 degrees
of freedom. All uncertainties are stated at a 1-sigma confidence level.
The 3-80 keV unabsorbed flux was 3.6x10^{-9} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding
to a luminosity of 3x10^{37} ergs s^{-1} at 8 kpc. The power law to disk
flux ratio is ~8 over 3-80 keV. Analysis of the other AstroSat instruments
is underway.

team members for scheduling the ToO observation, and for prompt provision
of the data.

ATEL #11376,"
We report the detection of a fast radio burst (FRB) on UTC 2018 March 1
at 07:34:19.76, during Breakthrough Listen observations with the 21-cm
multibeam receiver of the CSIRO Parkes radio telescope. The burst was detected
in beam 03 of the receiver only, which was centered on J2000 coordinates
RA 06:12:43.4, DEC +04:33:44.8, at a signal-to-noise ratio of ~16, peak
flux density of ~0.5 Jy, dispersion measure (DM) of ~520 pc cm^-2, and
burst width of ~3 ms, while observing over ~340 MHz of bandwidth centered
around 1382 MHz. The spectrum appears to be positive, i.e. brighter at
higher frequencies.  

The burst, FRB 180301, was detected during the Breakthrough Listen (BL)
Galactic plane survey [Isaacson et. al., PASP, 129, 9, 2017]. BL is foremostly
a search for technologically-capable life beyond Earth; however, a real-time
search for FRBs runs in tandem, using the HI-Pulsar digital system [Keith
et. al., MNRAS, 409, 2, 2010; Price et. al., JAI, 5, 4, 2016; Keane et
al., MNRAS, 473, 116, 2018]. The burst has also been detected with the
Breakthrough Listen digital backend using an independent  search technique
[Gajjar et al. 2017, ATel #10675]. After detection, calibration routines
were run and follow-up observations continued for approximately 2 hours;
no further bursts were found. The BL digital systems record voltage-level
data products to disk [MacMahon et al. arXiv:1707.06024v2], and these data
have been preserved.  Additional analysis is ongoing. 

The Galactic contribution to the DM along this line of sight is around
~155 pc cm^-3 using the NE2001 electron density model for the Milky Way
[Cordes & Lazio, arXiv:0207156v3, 2002], and 233 pc cm^-3 using the YMW16
model [Yao et al., ApJ, 835, 29, 2016]. Assuming a host Galaxy contribution
of ~100 pc cm^-2, we estimate the redshift to be around ~0.2, for zero
host contribution it is ~0.3.  

We encourage prompt multi-wavelength follow-up. Based on the half-power
beam width of the receiver, the positional uncertainty is of the order
of 14 arcminutes (radius).

We report the following spectroscopic classifications for the transients
detected by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN), i.e.,
ASASSN-18dv/SN 2017yj (ATel#11368) and ASASSN-18dm/SN 2017yc (ATel#11343).
All the spectra were obtained on UT 2018 Feb.28.5 - Feb.28.7 with the 2.4-m
telescope (+YFOSC) at Lijiang Observatory of Yunnan Observatories. Based
on the spectral comparison tools SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666,
1024) the classifications were given as: 

(1) The spectrum of ASASSN-18dv/SN 2017yj matches with the normal type
Ia supernova SN 2007ca at t = +3 days relative to the maximum light. Given
a redshift of 0.035 (from the SNID fit) for its host galaxy, an expansion
velocity of about 10300 km/s can be deduced from the Si II 635.5 absorption
minimum; 

(2) The spectrum of ASASSN-18dm/SN 2017yc matches with the normal type
Ia supernova SN 1999ek at t = +3 days relative to the maximum light. Given
a redshift of 0.035 (from the SNID fit) for its host galaxy, an expansion
velocity of about 10000 km/s can be deduced from the Si II 635.5 absorption
minimum.

We obtained optical spectra (range 360-870 nm) of SN 2018yo (= SNhunt353),
discovered by the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey Transient Survey
and Nikolay Mishevskiy, on UT Feb.28.83 2018 with the 2.4m telescope (+YFOSC)
at Lijiang Observatory of YNAO. The spectrum is consistent with that of
a type IIP supernova at a few weeks after the maximum light. Cross-correlation
with a library of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification""
code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, Ap.J., 666, 1024) shows that it matches
with SN 2006bp at t = +25 days from the maximum light. After correcting
for a redshift of 0.0134 for its host galaxy UGC 7840, an expansion velocity
of about 10000 km/s can be derived from the absorption minimum of Ha line.

fits to post-peak Type Ia supernovae at the redshift of the host galaxy

ATEL #11364,"
We report on SALT high-resolution spectroscopy of nova ASASSN-18ds, which
was discovered by Stanek et al. (2018; ATel #11348) on 2018 February 24.36
UT and was reported as a classical nova by Schmidtobreick et al. (2018;
ATel #11360) on 2018 February 26.96 UT.  Here we present a detailed description
of the high-resolution spectroscopy. 

We obtained a 1200 s spectrum of this nova under the SALT Large Science
Program on transients on 2018 February 27.08 (UTC; HJD 2458176.57), using
the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE,
91476) mounted on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Observations
were taken in the LR mode of HRS, covering a spectral range of 3800-8900
&#8491; at a resolution of R = 14,000. The data were reduced with the SALT
HRS MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068).  

The spectrum is dominated by narrow emission lines of H I, Fe II, O I,
Ca II, Mg I, Mg II, and Si II (see below a full list of the line identification).
The lines have P Cygni and rounded profiles, characteristics of optically
thick ejecta. We measure a FWHM of ~550 &plusmn; 50 km/s for H&#945; and
a FWHM of ~470 &plusmn; 50 km/s for H&#946;). The absorption components
are blue-shifted by ~240 &plusmn; 30 km/s. The line profiles and their
widths are consistent with the conclusion of Schmidtobreick et al. (2018;
ATel #11360) that the nova is still rising to maximum. We expect that future
spectroscopic follow-up show narrower lines with weaker or possibly no
emission profiles, while the nova eruption approaches the visual maximum.

We identify the interstellar Na I (D2) and (D1) absorption features. Their
large equivalent width (EW D2 ~ 1.6&#8491; and EW D1 ~ 1.48&#8491;) indicates
that the nova is highly reddened. This is consistent with its low Galactic
latitude.

ATEL #11365,"
Stanek et al. (ATel #11348) recently reported on the detection of a likely
Galactic Nova in the Milky Way disk, confirmed by spectroscopic observations
at ESO NTT and SALT telescopes (Schmidtobreick et al. 2018, ATel #11360;
Aydi et al. 2018, ATel #11364, respectively). ASASSN-18ds is located at
coordinates RA, DEC (J2000) = 17:03:47.509, -38:16:57.14, corresponding
to l, b = 347.384, 1.925, within the area covered by the VVV Survey in
the Galactic disk (vvvsurvey.org; Minniti et al. 2010, New Astronomy, 15,
433). 

Multiband near-IR VVV observations taken in 2010 show the presence of a
source 1.3 arcsec away from the reported target position. During the 2010-2013
seasons VVV Ks-band observations of the likely progenitor of Nova ASASSN-18ds
show no significant variation in brightness with mean_Ks=14.54+/-0.03,
which is within the VVV photometric errors at these magnitudes. Other nearby
sources found in the VVV data down to the limiting magnitude of Ks=18.1
mag in the field are more distant (about 4 arcs apart) from the reported
target position. 

According to Schlafly et al. (2011, ApJ 737, 103S) the mean extinction
for the region around the source position is A_V=7.38 mag, corresponding
to A_K=0.87 mag, assuming the Cardelli et al. (1989, ApJ, 345, 245) extinction
law.

ATEL #11366,"
We obtained an optical spectrum (range 4200-7550 Angs., FWHM resolution
= 3.5 Angs.) of ASASSN-18dw (ATel #11359, #11362) on UT 2018 Feb. 27.09
with ModSpec mounted on the MDM 2.4m telescope at KPNO. The spectrum shows
a blue continuum with weak, broad H-alpha and H-beta absorption, with narrow
emission cores, at z=0. The spectrum also shows the interstellar Na D doublet
in absorption with EW=0.9 Angstroms. The spectrum of ASASSN-18dw is consistent
with a dwarf nova in outburst.

ATEL #11367,"		Star, Variables

Our team has led a large effort to observe the Classical Be star HD6226
since last August when the amateur spectroscopist Olivier Thizy discovered
an outburst corresponding to an epoch where the star builds a decretion
disk. The star was previously analyzed by <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004A%26A...416..669B"">Bozic
et al. (2004)</a> who found the star to have quasi-periodic outbursts.
// 

We have collected over 200 spectra of the outburst that occurred in the
time span of August-October 2017, and had successfully proposed to obtain
ultraviolet spectra with the Hubble Space Telescope in order to constrain
the fundamental parameters of this star, allowing us to build better models
of the star+disk system. The UV spectra are scheduled for March 5, 2018
at 7:30-10:00 UT. In order to supplement these data, we obtained recent
optical spectroscopy with the APO 3.5 m telescope and echelle spectrograph.
Our data showed a large emission feature in the H-alpha profile indicating
that the star began building a disk since the last observation in the <a
href=""http://basebe.obspm.fr/basebe/"">BeSS database</a> on 2018 January
24.// 

Followup spectroscopy was obtained at both the Clarkson University Reynolds
Observatory and the University of Toledo's Ritter Observatory on February
27, 2018 UT. The spectra were taken within a few hours of each other with
the 0.3 m telescope at Clarkson and an LHIRES III spectrograph equipped
with a 1200 grooves/mm grating and with the 1 m telescope at Ritter Observatory
with a 1200 grooves/mm grating on a fiber-fed spectrograph. The followup
spectroscopy confirm the emission as well as show that the gas moved in
the ~day since the APO data were taken. Further reductions are necessary
to quantify the changes. // 

We request further observations of the optical spectrum to quantify this
emission episode and disk for modeling purposes. Further, near-infrared
observations would help to measure the free-free excess from the disk.
Past observations have shown that the star varies in optical light during
these outbursts, so optical photometry would be beneficial. //

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient. 

We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their

ATEL #11362,"
ASASSN-18dw was discovered on UT 2018-02-25.14 at g~14.3 as a transient
with an amplitude of more than four magnitudes by Stanek et al. (ATel#11359).
An analysis of the available archive near-IR photometry is presented in
an attempt to constrain the properties of the progenitor.  

A search in the Two Micron All Sky Syrvey (2MASS; Skrutskie et al. 2006
AJ 131, 1163) and The Deep Near Infrared Southern Sky Survey (DENIS; Epchtein
et al. 1997 Msngr 87, 27) databases revealed source counterparts, which
properties are summarized below: 

2MASS</br> 
Epoch of observation (JD) = 2451206.5658</br> 
J = 15.686+/-0.073</br> 
H = 15.117+/-0.083</br> 
Ks = 14.902+/-0.140</br> 
</br> 
DENIS </br> 
Epoch of observation (JD) = 2451514.751759</br> 
I = 16.86+/-0.10</br> 
J = 15.72+/-0.20</br> 

In the case of 2MASS All-Sky Release Point Source Catalog the counterpart
was located 0.16 arcseconds away from the position reported by Stanek et
al. 2018 (ATel#11359) and the DENIS DR3 (September 2005) position is 0.12
arcseconds away. Looking at the J band magnitudes of the source, it is
obvious that the source did not show significant variations in brightness
between Jan. 28th 1999 and Dec. 2nd 1999. Unfortunately both surveys were
conducted simultaneously (1997-2001 for 2MASS versus 1996-2001 for DENIS)
and do not give the chance to establish longer variability baseline. Also
taking into account that the source was detected only in the I and J bands
of DENIS, it is not possible to apply the transformations of Carpenter
2001 (AJ 121, 2851). On the other hand, considering the stable J magnitudes
it is possible to combine both datasets and compute colors that will set
some limits on the nature of the progenitor.  

The Galactic Dust Reddening and Extinction service within IRSA gives the
following values for the dust extinction in a 2 degrees region around the
transient position A_I=0.444, A_J=0.212, A_H=0.135, A_Ks=0.091 and A_V=0.786
magnitudes for the Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011 (ApJ 737, 103) reddening
maps. The corresponding colors, corrected for extinction are: 

(I-J)_0 = 0.946+/-0.124</br> 
(J-H)_0 = 0.492+/-0.111</br> 
(H-Ks)_0 = 0.171+/-0.163</br> 

Please note that only the errors of the photometry are taken into account
when calculating the uncertainties of the colors. Taking into account the
uncertainties, these colors are consistent with a main sequence star of
K spectral class, according to the data presented by Pecaut & Mamajek 2013
(ApJS 208, 9). They are also consistent with the same spectral and luminosity
class according to the data presented in Ducati et al. 2001 (ApJ 558, 309),
although some systematic differences in the (I-J) color are present in
this case. Only based on the colors, it is not possible to rule out that
the progenitor of the outburst does not belong to the giant or supergiant
luminosity class.  

In case of a K main sequence star, utilizing the data of Pecaut & Mamajek
2013 (ApJS 208, 9), a distance modulus between 9.8 and 10.1 could be estimated,
which means that the object is located further than the the Orion star
forming region. In the case of more luminous object (giant or supergiant),
the distance will only increase. Although there is a significant number
of heterogeneous photometric data points on the progenitor in different
archives, follow up photometry and spectroscopy are crucial to better constrain
the properties of the transient. 

"
ATEL #11356,"
We observed the new X-ray transient MAXI J1813-095 (ATels #11323, #11326,
#11332) with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) between 2018-02-22
20:52 UT and 2018-02-23 02:59 UT. Our observations were taken simultaneously
at 5.5 and 9 GHz, with a bandwidth of 2 GHz at each frequency. We used
1934-658 for flux calibration and 1819-096 for phase calibration. Data
were reduced in CASA version 4.7.0 (McMullin et al 2007). Imaging was carried
out using a rubustness of 0 and flux densities were measured by fitting
for a point source in the image plane. Due to its compact configuration
(750B), we did not include the isolated antenna 6 when imaging, leading
to angular resolutions of 108"" x 7.31"" and 68.4"" x 4.63"" at 5.5 and 9 GHz,
respectively, at a position angle of -177.8 degrees east of north.  

We significantly detect MAXI J1813-095 at the position (measured at 9 GHz):</br>

RA (J2000): 18:13:34.073 +/- 0.014</br> 
Dec (J2000): -9:32:07.3 +/- 3.7</br> 
where the 1-sigma errors are the larger of the statistical error from the
fitted position (Declination error) or the theoretical statistical error
of centroiding (Beam/2*SNR; Right Ascension error). There may be larger
systematic errors that we do not include. Using Galactic disk and bulge
stellar populations (Juric et al 2008; McMillan 2011) and excluding the
potential effect of any natal supernova kick, a source along this line
of sight has a likely distance of 8^+6/-2 kpc (1 &sigma; confidence interval).
We measure flux densities of 0.69 +/- 0.06 mJy and 0.47 +/- 0.04 mJy at
5.5 and 9 GHz, respectively, implying a radio spectral index of &alpha;=
-0.7 +/- 0.2, where S<sub>&nu;</sub> &prop; nu<sup>&alpha;</sup>. Given
this spectral index, the radio emission converts to a 5-GHz luminosity
of 4*&pi;*&nu; f<sub>&nu;</sub> d<sup>2</sup> = (3.3 +/- 0.4)E29*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup>
erg/s. 

Swift/XRT observed MAXI J1813-095 on 2018-02-21 (between 11:40:06 and 11:58:12
UT) and 2018-02-23 (22:25:00 to 22:44:00 UT), bracketing our radio observation.
We extracted the data using the online XRT pipeline (Evans et al. 2009)
and fit with an absorbed power-law model. On 2018-02-21 we find a best
fit with an N_H of (9.6 +/- 0.2)E21<sup>2</sup> and a photon index of 1.45
+/- 0.07, providing an unabsorbed 1-10 keV X-ray flux of (7.8 +/- 0.2)E-10
erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to a 1-10 keV X-ray luminosity of (5.95
+/- 0.15)E36*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup> erg/s. On 2018-02-23, we find an N_H
of (1.1 +/- 0.3)E21<sup>2</sup> and a photon index of 1.5 +/- 0.1, providing
an unabsorbed 1-10 keV X-ray flux of (7.9 +/- 0.3)E-10 erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>,
corresponding to a 1-10 keV X-ray luminosity of (6.05 +/- 0.15)E36*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup>
erg/s. 

The X-ray luminosities and spectrum are consistent with the source being
in the low-Eddington part of the hard state, typical of the early part
of an outburst. This state is associated with a compact steady jet, as
opposed to jet ejecta (which is associated with the transition between
the hard and soft state at higher luminosities). Espinasse and Fender (2018)
suggested that radio-quiet hard state black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs)
have steeper indices (&alpha;=-0.2+/-0.3) than radio-loud hard state BHXBs
(&alpha;=0.2+/-0.2). We measure a spectral index that is consistent with
the optically thin spectra expected from jet ejecta (&alpha;~-0.6), potentially
consistent with compact jets in radio-quiet hard-state BHXBs, and inconsistent
with compact jets in radio-loud hard-state BHXBs. 

Comparing the luminosities to those of hard-state XBs, MAXI J1813-095 is
consistent with radio-quiet BHXBs and radio-loud neutron star XBs; however,
we caution that this correlation would not apply to jet ejecta. Given the
consistency of the X-ray properties, the radio spectral index and the radio/X-ray
correlation with the properties of radio-quiet BHXBs, MAXI J1813-095 may
be a radio-quiet BHXB. 

We thank Jamie Stevens and ATNF staff for making these observations possible.

"
ATEL #11357,"
We observed the new transient MAXI J1813-095 (see ATels #11323, #11326,
#11332, #11356) from 2018 February 23th 02:57 to 18:13 UTC with INTEGRAL
in order to measure the intrinsic properties of the broad-band X-ray spectrum
and to obtain more information about the nature of the source.  

We obtained an effective exposure of about 30ks in both JEM-X and ISGRI.
We used the quick look analysis of the NRT data provided by the ISDC for
our analysis and combined them with contemporaneous Swift/XRT observations
taken later on the same day (ObsID 00010563003).  

We find that the spectrum between 0.5--200keV is well described by an absorbed
power-law with an exponential cutoff at high energies. The best fit parameters
are: absorption column N_H =  1.18^{+0.15}_{-0.14}e22 cm^-2, photon index
Gamma = 1.57\pm0.10, and cutoff energy E_cut = 140^{+120}_{-50} keV (90%
uncertainties). The spectral parameters agree well with the ones reported
for the soft spectrum by Kennea et al. (ATel #11326). 
The measured column density is about a factor of two above the expected
Galactic column of ~5e21cm^-2 (Dickey & Lockman, 1990). 
The unabsorbed flux between 2--100keV is 7.0\pm0.4e-10 erg/s/cm^2, which
corresponds to a luminosity of ~5e36 erg/s at 8kpc (see Russell et al.,
ATel #11356). 

The improvement using a cutoff-powerlaw over a straight power law seems
significant with a Delta Chi^2 of 14 for one more variable parameter, resulting
in a chance improvement possibility of 0.2% according to the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC). However, we caution that the exact values and significance
may change with the consolidated data. 

The spectral shape is consistent with the source being a new black-hole
transient in a low/hard state, as typically seen during the beginning of
an outburst. Further multi-wavelength observations are encouraged to follow-up
and monitor MAXI J1813 during its current outburst. 

We thank the INTEGRAL project scientist, the ISOC, and the ISDC for the
prompt processing and scheduling of our DDT observation and their support
with the analysis.

"
ATEL #11358,"
We report on optical observations of the field of Swift J1658.2-4242 with
the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) 1-m robotic telescopes. The X-ray (ATel
#11306, #11321) and radio (ATel #11322) properties of the source suggest
this new transient could be a black hole X-ray binary (BHXB). The source
was discovered by Swift BAT on 16 February 2018 (GCN #22416) and was also
detected on 14 February 2018 by INTEGRAL (ATel #11306). Possible X-ray
pulsations were reported at a frequency of ~0.115 Hz with Swift XRT (ATel
#11311), however a follow-up NuSTAR observation detected a periodocity
that increased in frequency from ~0.138 Hz to ~0.166 Hz, indicating that
this is a QPO, commonly seen in BHXBs in the hard state. A flat radio spectrum
observed with ATCA, and the position of the source on the radio - X-ray
correlation, favour a BHXB at a distance of > 3 kpc (ATel #11322). 

There is an optical and infrared source in several catalogues consistent
with the position of the radio and X-ray counterpart (ATel #11334, #11342).
An optical spectrum of this object taken with the SOAR telescope (ATel
#11342) is consistent with a mid to late K star, with foreground extinction
E(B-V)=1.4+/-0.1 mag and no accretion signatures. It was unclear from the
SOAR observation if the source had brightened from catalogue magnitudes.

We observed the field of Swift J1658.2-4242 with the 1-m LCO network of
telescopes (the nodes at Cerro Tololo, Chile and the South African Astronomical
Observatory (SAAO), South Africa) on 22, 23, 24 and 25 February in the
SDSS i' and r'-bands. We detect a single source at the radio position (see
link to our finding chart below). The PSF of the object is consistent with
being a point source (the seeing was 1.0"" in our best image on 22 Feb),
and we detect no other sources close by (the nearest star is 8 arcsec away).
Using several stars from the VPHAS+ DR2 survey (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.440.2036D"">Drew
et al 2014, MNRAS, 440, 2036</a>) to calibrate the field, we report the
following AB magnitudes for this source: 

22 Feb (MJD 58171.3): i_{AB}=19.05 +- 0.06 

23 Feb (MJD 58172.1): i_{AB}=19.07 +- 0.06 

24 Feb (MJD 58173.3): i_{AB}=19.11 +- 0.07; r_{AB}=20.31 +- 0.11 

25 Feb (MJD 58174.3): i_{AB}=19.09 +- 0.05; r_{AB}=20.05 +- 0.06 

The VPHAS catalogued AB magnitudes are i_{AB}=19.02 +- 0.04; r_{AB}=20.20
+- 0.09. Our LCO magnitudes agree with the VPHAS values within errors,
with no evidence for variability, except possibly a slight brightening
in the r'-band filter, although this would need follow-up observations
to confirm. All X-ray binaries brighten at optical wavelengths during outburst,
so we conclude that this source is very likely to be a foreground line-of-sight
star unrelated to the X-ray binary, as the SOAR spectrum also suggested
(ATel #11342). However, we note that this chance alignment is surprising
given the density of stars in our image (see link to our finding chart
below). 

The total Galactic extinction in this direction is A_v~58.6 mag (ATel #11334),
and the neutral hydrogen column measured from X-ray spectroscopy is NH
~ (1.3 - 1.9) x 10^{23} cm^{-2} (ATel #11307, #11310, #11321, #11336).
Using the NH/A_v relation of <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.471.3494Z"">Zhu
et al. (2017, MNRAS, 471, 3494)</a>, this NH corresponds to a dust extinction
of A_v ~ 62 - 91 mag. It is therefore not surprising that we do not detect
the optical counterpart. Deep infrared observations are encouraged (K-band
or longer wavelengths) to attempt to detect the counterpart. 

The LCO observations are part of an on-going <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/faulkesxrb"">monitoring
campaign</a> of ~ 40 low-mass X-ray binaries (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2751"">Lewis
et al. 2008</a>) with LCO and the Faulkes Telescopes. This work makes use
of observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO).

We report the classification of the transient ASASSN-18ds, detected by
the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014)
on 2018-02-24.36 at V~14.3 (Stanek et al. 2018, ATel #11348). Three consecutive
observations of 180s, 60s and 80s starting on 2018-02-25 at 09:47 UT were
performed with EFOSC2 and Grism 13 (3985-9315, 18 A resolution) mounted
on the ESO New Technology Telescope at La Silla. The spectrum is dominated
by the strong emission blend of Halpha and [NII]. In addition to the Balmer
lines, strong FeII emission lines are present, blended with their respective
blue-shifted absorption lines. We interpret the spectrum as that of an
FeII-class nova during the pre-maximum phase. 

Unfortunately, the object is slightly saturated on the R acquisition image.
Comparing with the brightest star in the field, USNO 0450.26357218, which
is not saturated, we find that the nova is brighter than R=12.4mag during
our observation. This confirms that it is still on the rise to maximum.

The observations were taken and reduced by students of the ESO/NEON observing
school 2018.

We report the classification of the supernova candidate ASASSN-18dl which
was discovered as a V~17.6mag transient by the All Sky Automated Survey
for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014) on 2018-02-21.25 UT. The
discovery is reported in ATel #11343 (Stone et al. 2018). A 600s exposure
was obtained on 2018-02-25 at 03:26 UT with EFOSC2 and Grism 13 (3985-9315,
18A resolution) mounted on the ESO New Technology Telescope at La Silla.
Using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007) we classify the transient as a SNe Ia
similar to 2006cf at an age of 2d and an approximate redshift of z=0.033
consistent with the suspected host galaxy 2MASX J10023148+1343409 as given
by NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED). GELATO (Harutyunyan et al.,
2008) confirms the SN 1a classification matching 1999ac. Using the redshift
z=0.033537 of the host galaxy to correct the SiII 635.5nm absorption line,
we determine the expansion velocity as ~10630 km/s. The observation and
analysis were performed by students of the ESO/NEON observing school taking
place in La Silla right now.

We report on a new NIR flare of the high redshift Blazar 3c454.3 (z=0.859),
also known as HB89 2251+158 associated with the gamma-ray source 2FGL2253.9+1609.
Our most recent NIR photometry for this source shows that on December 29th,2017
(JD2458116.609456), the object brightness corresponded to H = 12.669 +/-
0.02. While, in a previous observation in this band (MJD2458063) the object
had a magnitude H = 13.708 +/- 0.03. This particular flare turned out to
be very red. The increment en the J band was only 0.7 mag, while in the
H band was 1.0 mag and in the Ks band an increment of 1.45 mag was observed.
Hence, the object has increased its luminosity by a factor of about 3.8
in K in this rather short lapse. This behavior is consistent with a fresh
injection of relativistic electrons onto a magnetized zone. The source
has shown flaring activity in the past (see ATels # 6213 and # 8589) of
Our observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo
Haro Observatory operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics
and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera.
We strongly encourage further multiwavelength coverage.

discovery is reported in ATel #11343 (Stone et al. 2018). Three consecutive

the S/N. We used SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007) to identify the type and
redshift of the SN spectra. The spectra matches the SNe Ia 2006cp at -10d
and an approximate redshift of z=0.032, consistent with the suspected host
galaxy 2MASX J06105892-3341177 (z=0.038) as given by NASA/IPAC Extragalactic

We report optical spectroscopic confirmation of the recent M31 nova candidate
ASASSN-18ca (= PNV J00423439+4044255), discovered independently by Koichi
Itagaki (Yamagata, Japan) and by J. Brimacombe et al. (ATel #11275). Raj
et al. (ATel #11292) obtained spectra of the object and have suggested
that the nova belongs to the Fe II class. 

We obtained additional spectroscopic observations on 2018 Feb. 17.710 UT
using the Russian BTA telescope equipped with the SCORPIO spectrograph.
The spectrum was taken with a resolution of 5.3 &Aring; in the 4050 - 5840
&Aring; range. The photometry of the nova was obtained just before the
time of the BTA spectrum with the same device, and gave B = 19.1 &plusmn;
0.1, V = 19.1 &plusmn; 0.1, Rc = 18.22 &plusmn; 0.08. 

The nova shows strong and broad Balmer emission lines together with many
Fe II lines. In the case of the principal lines: H-delta, H-gamma, H-beta,
Fe II 4923 &Aring;, and 5018 &Aring; we found FWHM = 2800, 2720, 2650,
2980, 2880 km/sec,  respectively, with errors &plusmn; 20-30 km/sec. The
widths were corrected for spectral resolution. All these lines have sharp
wings with flat and structured tops. In addition to these Balmer and Fe
II lines, we also see evidence for the N III, C III Bowen blend at 4640,
4650 &Aring; along with possible N II 5679 &Aring; and [N II] 5755 &Aring;
emission features.  We conclude that ASASSN-18ca is most likely a Hybrid
nova or a broad-lined Fe II (Fe IIb) nova in the classification scheme
of Williams (1992, AJ, 104, 725).

ATEL #11338,"
We report on high-resolution spectroscopy of PNV J17244011-2421463 which
was reported as a possible nova by T. Kojima, Gunma-ken, Japan (CBAT follow-up:
http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/unconf/followups/J17244011-2421463.html).

We obtained a 1200 s spectrum of this object under the SALT Large Science
Program on transients on 2018 February 23.127 (HJD 2458172.6254), using
the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE,
91476) mounted on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Observations
were taken in the LR mode of HRS, covering a spectral range of 3800-8900
&#8491; at a resolution of R = 14,000. The data were reduced with the SALT
HRS MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068).  

The spectrum is dominated by narrow emission lines of H I, Fe II, Na I,
Al II, Ca II, Mg I, Mg II, O I, [O II], [O III], and N II (see below a
full list of the line identification). We also note the presence of relatively
weak He I lines. The lines are characterized by strong absorption dips
on top of the emission features. The absorption dip is at around +60 km/s.
We measure a FWZI of ~1300 &plusmn; 100 km/s (for H&#945; and H&#946;).
The emission lines and their profiles are characteristic of a classical
novae of the Fe II spectroscopic class. The presence of weak [O III] 4959
and 5007 lines might indicate that the nova is evolving towards the nebular
phase.

J2000.0) that we are pursuing at the Astronomical Observatory of the University
of Siena may indicate a new rising phase for the optical brightness of
the source, with the R-band Vega magnitude dropping below R=12.5 on Feb
19.98, while at the beginning of January the source had faded to R~13.2.
However our sampling has been hampered by recurrent bad weather and we
can not infer any firm conclusion on the actual trend from our sparse data
set. The results of our observations are summarized in the following table:

Observations for each available night consist of  4 x 300 s exposures
in the Johnson-Cousins R filter, taken in 2x2 binning under good observing
conditions with clear sky. Seeing ranged between 4.5"" and 5"" (FWHM). After
dark current subtraction and flat field correction the images for each
night were averaged and aperture photometry was performed on the average
frame by means of the MaximDL software package. Reference and check stars
in the field of view were taken from the finding chart made available by
Landessternwarte Koenigstuhl at https://www.lsw.uni-heidelberg.de/projects/extragalactic/charts/0716+714.html
. The reference R magnitudes for these stars are taken from Villata et
al., A&AS 130, 305 (1998). Quoted uncertainty is statistical only. We will
continue monitoring the source in the following nights. Multi-wavelength
follow-up is encouraged.

Any enquiry on these observations can be addressed either to Alessandro
Marchini (alessandro.marchini@unisi.it)  or to Giacomo Bonnoli (giacomo.bonnoli@unisi.it).

The Astronomical Observatory of the University of Siena runs a remotely
operated 0.3 m f/5.6 Maksutov-Cassegrain reflector, installed on a German
equatorial mount. The instrument is hosted in a dome on the roof of the
Department building, 0.7 km southwards of the city center (43 18 45 N 11
20 12 E). Site elevation is around 300 m above sea level. The telescope
is equipped with a Johnson-Cousins BVRI filter wheel and a STL-6303 SBig
CCD (3072 x 2048 9 micron pixels) capable of imaging a 58 x 38 square arcminutes
field of view with a resolution of 2.3""/pixel (in binning 2x2).

We provide X-ray counterparts for the unidentified Swift/BAT sources listed
in the 105 month catalogue (Oh et al. 2018, ApJS in press). 
These associations were found by cross-correlating the list of U1,U2 and
U3 sources with the ROSAT Bright (RASSBSC, Voges et al. 1999, A&A, 349,
389) and the XMM-Newton Slew (XMMSlew, Saxton et al. 2008, A&A, 480, 611)
catalogues. Using the method developed by Stephen et al. (2005, A&A, 432,
L49), we find a strong correlation  
with 26 (RASSBSC, R in table)  and 11 associations (XMMSlew, X) respectively
with around one of these expected by chance alignment. Considering only
U1 and U2 sources, we find 9 associations which are listed below 
where for each BAT source we report position and relative error of the
X-ray counterpart, its distance from the BAT source position compared to
the BAT 90% error radius, the catalogue used and information (redshift
and class) on the optical counterpart. Optical identifications were found
using the RASSBSC positional and the XMMSlew astrometric uncertainties.

In 3  cases the X-ray counterpart is outside the 90% BAT error circle but
inside the 99%  positional uncertainty. We also retrieved and analysed
the 6dFGS spectrum of 6dFGS J210322.1-214756 and 6dFGS J134043.6-281105
as well as the LAMOST  spectrum of SWIFTJ0156.1+4463 but only in the last
two cases were we able to classify the objects.

SWIFTJ0628.7-8346 is likely an AGN because its WISE colours are typical
of this class.

We provide X-ray counterparts for unidentified Swift/BAT sources in the
105 month catalogue (Oh et al. 2018, ApJS in press). 
They were found by cross-correlating the list of U1,U2 and U3 sources with
the ROSAT Bright (RASSBSC, Voges et al. 1999, A&A, 349, 389) and XMM-Newton
Slew (XMMSlew, Saxton et al. 2008, A&A, 480, 611) catalogues and optically
identified  as reported in  Atel #11340. 
For U3 sources, we find 15 associations listed below. 
For SWIFT J1105.4+0200 two possible X-ray counterparts were found; XRT
data indicate that both are viable associations as both are detected above
3 keV.

For 2 sources we retrieved and analysed 6dFGS spectra: 2MASS J19095128+4058466
is classified as an AGN candidate in Simbad while XMMSL2 J190921.2+011225

is most likely of galactic origin being located close to the galactic plane
and displaying WISE colours which are not typical of an AGN.

"
ATEL #11342,"
Swift J1658.2-4242 is a new transient discovered by Swift (GCN #22416 and
#22417). NuSTAR observation of this indicates presence of a broad iron
line and quasi-periodic oscillations (ATel #11321) and Radio observations
by ATCA show a strong radio counterpart with a flat radio spectral slope
(ATel #11322). These all suggest Swift J1658.2-4242 is likely to be a black
hole X-ray binary. 

Within the small (< 0.5"") error circle of the ATCA position, there is a
single optical source in archival imaging. The published mean magnitudes
of this source are  r=20.07 and i=18.65, from VPHAS+ DR2 (Drew et al 2014,
MNRAS, 440, 2036). We observed this source on UT 2018 Feb 22.4 with the
Goodman Spectrograph on the SOAR telescope.  

We note that no new source beyond this archival source was present in acquisition
images taken with a long-pass filter. This non-standard filter makes it
challenging to determine whether the source has brightened compared to
the archival data.  
Comparison with field stars suggests that any such brightening is < 1.5
mag, but a smaller change in its magnitude is not ruled out. 

Our 1200-sec SOAR spectrum, covering the region of 4800 to 8800 A, is consistent
with a normal mid to late K star, with an approximate Teff of 4000 to 4600
K. The most prominent absorption lines are those of the Ca triplet, and
given a barycentric radial velocity of about -20 km/s. We see no evidence
for H or He emission in any lines covered by our spectrum, nor evidence
of a disk-like continuum. The reddening estimated from an SED fit to the
spectrum is E(B-V)=1.4+/-0.1 mag. 

We separately considered archival H and K photometry for this optical source
as observed in the VVV survey DR2 (Minniti et al 2010, New Ast, 15, 433).
Comparing these magnitudes to Padova solar metallicity isochrones for an
age of 10 Gyr, the H-K vs. K color-magnitude diagram suggests E(B-V) =
1.3 for an assumed distance of 8 kpc and E(B-V) = 1.4 for a distance of
3 kpc (the minimum distance indicated by the radio/X-ray emission; ATel
#11322). The resulting absolute magnitude of the optical source would imply
classification as a red giant for any distance > 4 kpc; at 3 kpc the source
could also be a subgiant.  

Hence, if this source is the counterpart to the X-ray binary, it is likely
to be an evolved star. However, the absence of accretion signatures in
the spectrum, and the lack of evidence for a brighter optical counterpart,
suggest that this optical source may well not be the counterpart to Swift
J1658.2-4242. Deeper imaging could help determine whether there is another
possible counterpart to the X-ray source.

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient. 

We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their
continued support of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation through grant GBMF5490 to the Ohio State University,
NSF grant AST-1515927, the Mt. Cuba Astronomical Foundation, the Center
for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics (CCAPP) at OSU, the Chinese Academy
of Sciences South America Center for Astronomy (CASSACA), and the Villum

In ATEL #11344, we state in the title that we found 28 supernova. This

ATEL #11346,"
We report the optical spectroscopic observation of the supernova candidate
ASASSN-18da (2018vw) using SALT/RSS (350.0-920.0 nm) on UT 2018-02-22 18:42:48
taken under the SALT Large Science Program on transients. The target was
discovered by All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee
et al. 2014) as reported in Atel #11343. We used SNID (Blondin & Tonry,
2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) to identify the type, phase, and redshift of the
SN spectra. The spectra matches with 91T-like SNe Ia a few days before
peak at an approximate redshift of z=0.02.

"
ATEL #11330,"
We obtained an optical spectrum of DLT18h/SN2018xx (Atel #11328) on UT
2018 February 22.2 with the Goodman Spectrograph on the SOAR telescope.
Spectral classification was performed with SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007,
ApJ, 666, 1024), with good matches to normal type Ia supernovae roughly
two weeks before maximum light, in accordance with the current absolute
magnitude of M_V~-16 mag.  There is also a clear carbon notch (at CII 6580
Angstroms) in the spectrum.  We encourage further observations. 

"
ATEL #11331,"
We report on NIR photometry of the radio source GB6J0713+5738, tentatively
identified with the Gamma-ray source Fermi J0713+5739 (ATels #10149, #11056).
On January 22nd, 2018, we observed a source coincident with the radio source
coordinates, finding that on MJD2458140.8592, its fluxes corresponded to
J = 16.448 +/- 0.07, H = 15.865 +/- 0.02 and Ks = 14.931 +/- 0.05. Those
NIR colors are typical of blazars. Furthermore, the source was not detected
in the 2mass NIR survey, this fact implies that at the time of the survey
the source had H > 17.5. Hence, this source has increased its NIR flux
by a factor of about 10 in this lapse and it is presently undergoing an
important NIR flare event. This activity strongly suggests that the counterpart
of the source Fermi J0713+5739 is indeed the radio source GB6J0713+5738.
Our observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo
Haro Observatory operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics
and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera.
We encourage further multi wavelength coverage.

RA(J2000) = 18:13:34.015

Dec(J2000) = -09:31:59.20

Source B = PSO J181333.964-093158.045

RA(J2000) = 18:13:33.970

Dec(J2000) = 09:31:57.94

with uncertainties of 0.05"" and 0.07"" in RA and Dec, respectively.

We measure the following AB magnitudes (calibrated against PanSTARRS in
griz and against 2MASS in JHK, not corrected for Galactic foreground reddening):

Source A:

g' = 21.55 +/- 0.11

r' = 19.69 +/- 0.02

i' = 18.65 +/- 0.01 

Z' = 17.92 +/- 0.01

J =  17.14 +/- 0.07

H =  16.74 +/- 0.05

K =  16.68 +-/ 0.06

Source B:

g' = >23.3 

r' = 20.04 +/- 0.02

i' = 18.63 +/- 0.01 

Z' = 17.68 +/- 0.01

J =  16.44 +/- 0.08

H =  15.76 +-/ 0.07

K =  15.74 +-/ 0.07

While the GROND photometry of Source B is consistent with the catalogued
PanSTARRS values, Source A has brightened by ~1 magnitude in i and z with
respected to the PanSTARRS observations (g, r, and y band photometry  for
this source is not included in the PanSTARRS DR1 catalog). We therefore
suggest that Source A is the likely counterpart of MAXI J1813-095.

The new X-ray and radio transient source Swift J1658.2-4242 
(GCN #22416, #22417, #22419; ATel #11306, #11307, #11310, #11311, #11318,
#11321, #11322, #11334) 
has been recently observed by INTEGRAL, from 2018 February 20 at 14:04

to 2018 February 22 at 15:03:12 (UTC), during a monitoring dedicated to
this source.

We report the results from a preliminary data analysis of these data. 
Swift J1658.2-4242 is detected in the IBIS/ISGRI mosaic 
(based on data from 2018 February 20 at 14:04 to February 22 at 02:22,
UTC; exposure time 125 ks) 
at a significance of 121 sigma in the 20-40 keV energy range 
and about 46 sigma in the 40-80 keV energy range. 
The corresponding fluxes estimated from the IBIS/ISGRI mosaics are 
100+/-1 mCrab  and 67+/-1 mCrab, respectively.

Swift J1658.2-4242 is also detected in the JEM-X mosaics 
(same observations used for the ISGRI mosaics, see above) 
at a significance of 59 sigma in the 3-10 keV energy range 
and about 37 sigma in the 10-20 keV energy range. The corresponding fluxes

calculated from the JEM-X mosaics are 100+/-2 mCrab  and 115+/-3 mCrab,
respectively.

We measured the fluxes of Swift J1658.2-4242 in mCrab, 
using the most recently available calibration observation of the Crab carried
out 
during the satellite revolution 1921 (from 2018 February 17 at 22:39 to
2018 February 18 at 11:59, UTC).

The average JEM-X + ISGRI spectrum (3-100 keV) can be reasonably well described
(chi2_red=1.5, 24 d.o.f.) 
by an absorbed power law with photon index 2.61+/-0.04 
(we fixed the absorption column density at N_H=1.3E23 cm^-2, 
as previously reported in the ATel #11321). Uncertainties are given at
68% c.l. 
The estimated flux from the spectral fit is about 3.6E-9 ergs/cm^2/s in
the energy range 3 - 100 keV.

A more detailed spectral analysis will be carried on the consolidated INTEGRAL
data.

We are grateful to the INTEGRAL team for rapidly planning the requested
observation.

In ATel#11331, we reported the NIR detection of the radio source GB60713+5738
and the suggestion 
of it being in flaring state. However, we found a previous observation
in our archive that fully 
confirms a recent giant flare of this object. On December 29th, 2017 (MJD2458116.972963),
we observed 
the source with NIR fluxes J = 15.642 +/- 0.04, H = 14.807 +/- 0.02, Ks
= 14.931 +/- 0.05. In January 
22nd,2018, the source had declined to our flux values reported on ATel#11331,
ie. the source had fainted by a factor of 3 in one month. This fact is
consistent with the renew gamma-ray activity of Fermi J0713+5739 (ATel#11056)
and provides further evidence for the radio and the NIR sources 
being the counterparts of the gamma-ray one. Our observations are carried
out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated
by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico),
equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera. We encourage further
multi wavelength coverage.

The X-ray transient Swift J1658.2-4242 was detected on 18.02.18UT with
initial coordinates RA=16h58m11s and Dec=-42d42'31"" with an uncertainty
of 3 arcmin (GCN #22416). (All coordinates in this contribution are in
equinox J2000.) The subsequent analysis of the XRT/UVOT data resulted in
more precise coordinates RA=16h58m12.64s and Dec=-42d41'54.5'', with error
radius 1.6'' at 90% confidence (ATel #11307). Within the error circle two
known sources were encountered VVV J16581262-42415478 and GLIMPSE G343.2514+00.0537
(ATel #11310). The ATCA radio observations of the transient (ATel #11322)
yield RA=16h58m12.700+/-0.004, Dec=-42d41'56.09+/-0.25 (statistical errors
only). Both positions agree within the uncertainty of the measurements,
but the reported counterparts are outside of the error circle of the radio
position. A dedicated search around the new reported position resulted
in the detection of a counterpart in three catalogs: 2MASS J16581268-4241563
(located 0.33"" away, but consistent within the positional uncertainty of
the 2MASS PSC), VVV J165812.68-424156.25 (0.21"" away) and GAIA 5966232529369270784
(0.25"" away). The 2MASS magnitudes of the source are J=16.038+/-0.106,
H=15.116, Ks=15.055 with photometry flags AUU, which means that H and Ks
magnitudes are reported as upper limits. The VVV source have magnitudes
J=16.046+/-0.012, H=15.381+/-0.016, Ks=14.996+/-0.027. Taking into account
the J band data in the epoch of 2MASS and VVV, along with the H and Ks
magnitudes it is obvious that there are no significant changes in the near-IR
flux of the source. The GAIA DR1 magnitude of 5966232529369270784 is 19.604.
According to the Schlafly&Finkbeiner 2011 reddening maps, the extinction
in the V band is 58.6 magnitudes, corresponding to Aj=15.7, Ah=9.98, Ak=6.7
magnitudes. Applying these will result in unreasonably blue near-IR colors.
Obviously the extinction estimates are unreliable due to the proximity
of the position to the Galactic plane. Based on the near-IR colors from
the VVV data (without extinction correction): J-Ks=1.05+/-0.03, J-H=0.67+/-0.02,
H-Ks=0.38+/-0.03, the source could be identified as a M6-M8 main sequence
or giant star (Pecaut&Mamajek 2013, Ducati ey al. 2001). If we consider
a main sequence star, the resulting V band magnitude will be in the order
of 23. If a M6III object is considered, the resulting V~20 mag is broadly
consistent with the G band magnitude reported by Gaia. (Note that the Gaia
G band is fully encompassing the widely used V band filter.) Based on the
reported characteristics of the counterparts, the uncertainty of the available
extinction estimates and the interesting nature of the transient further
optical and near-IR follow-up observations are strongly encouraged.

ATEL #11327,"
Monitoring with the Gehrels Swift observatory's X-Ray Telescope detected
an X-ray flux increase from the magnetar 1E 1048.1-5937 in January 2018
(Archibald et al., ATEL #11241). The Neutron star Interior Composition
Explorer (NICER; Gendreau et al. 2012, SPIE Conference Series, Vol. 8443)
performed two follow-up X-ray observations on January 30 (ObsID 1020240126)
and February 6 (ObsID 1020240127), 2018, with exposures of 728 and 2520
seconds, respectively.  

The recently acquired 0.7-8.0 keV NICER spectra were fit jointly with earlier
data, including an 8.9 ks NICER dataset from late July and early August
2017, as well as an XMM-Newton EPIC-pn 0.3-8.0 keV observation from December
28, 2000 (ObsID 0112780401; Tiengo et al. 2002, A&A 383, 182). The spectra
are successfully modeled (chi2/d.o.f. = 1.052 at 1079 d.o.f.) by a blackbody
plus a power-law component, with independent parameters at each epoch,
attenuated by interstellar absorption ('phabs' in XSPEC, Anders & Grevesse
1989 abundance), with the absorbing column-density linked across all datasets.
We confirmed the increase in flux, to (2.2-2.3)E-11 erg/s/cm2 (absorbed)
in the 0.5-10 keV band, during the last two NICER observations. Preliminary
best-fit blackbody temperatures are 0.64-0.69 keV, with column density
NH = (0.85+/-0.06)E22 cm-2 (1-sigma statistical uncertainty) and power-law
photon index 2.2-3.9. In each observation, typical statistical uncertainties
of the spectral parameters are at the level of a few percent. 

The NICER observations of July-August 2017 show that, compared to its quiescent
level in 2000, the source was already in a higher flux state, by almost
a factor of three. In 2018, the flux increased further so that the source
was approximately four times brighter than in quiescence. In contrast to
conclusions drawn from past brightening episodes, where the dominant spectral
change was found (Tam et al. 2008, ApJ 677, 573) to be in the power-law
component, the derived 2018 spectral parameters suggest that this activation
is mainly due to an increase in the blackbody emitting radius, which changed
from ~1.6 km to ~3.4 km assuming a distance of 9 kpc (Durant & van Kerkwijk
2006, ApJ, 650, 1070).  In the 0.7-8.0 keV range, we also computed the
pulsed fraction [defined as PF = (max - min)/(max + min) of the pulse profile
folded with period 6.4629755 s] for the last NICER observation on February
6, 2018, and found PF ~48%, significantly lower than the 81% measured in
the December 2000 XMM-Newton observation. A similar anticorrelation between
flux and pulsed fraction has been reported several times for this source
(Tiengo et al. 2005, A&A 437, 997; Gavriil et al. 2006, ApJ 641, 418; Tam
et al. 2008, ApJ 677, 573; Dib, Kaspi, & Gavriil 2009, ApJ 702, 614). 

These results are in agreement with the findings of Guver et al. (2015;
ApJ 801, 48), where the authors modeled pulse profiles for this source
using neutron star atmosphere models and inferred that the size of the
hot spot changed from 80 degrees to 30 degrees from an outburst state in
2007 to quiescence in 2011. Such a change in the spot size was also suggested
by Tam et al. (2008, ApJ 677, 573) as a reason for the observed anticorrelation
between flux and pulsed fraction.

At 16:40UT on February 20th, 2018, Swift began a target of opportunity
observation of the position of the new MAXI detected transient MAXI J1813-095
(Kawase et al. 2018; ATel #11323). We performed a 7-point tiling observation
in order to cover the MAXI error region, with an exposure of 500s per tile.
In the central tile we find a bright uncatalogued X-ray source at the following
coordinates: RA/Dec (J2000) = 273.39169, -9.53307, which is equivalent
to:  

RA(J2000) = 18h 13m 34.0s, 

Dec(J2000) = -09h 31m 59.0 

with an estimated uncertainty of 2.2 arc-seconds radius (90% containment).
This position is not consistent with the location of any previously know
X-ray transient, and therefore we conclude that this is a new transient
X-ray source, MAXI J1813-095.  

The XRT Photon Counting mode spectrum is well fit by an absorbed power-law
model, with a photon index of 1.45 +/- 0.23 and absorption column N<sub>H</sub>
= 1.3 +/- 0.3 x 10<sup>22</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>. The average flux, corrected
for absorption is 1.2 x 10<sup>-9</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (0.5 - 10
keV). 

BAT has also detected the new X-ray transient MAXI J1813-095 as a sub-threshold
source in its on-board images, with the earliest detection in a 17 minute
image starting at 03:58 UT on 2018 Feb 19.  The average location of these
on-board detections is RA, Dec = 273.355, -9.478 which is 

RA(J2000) = 18h 13m 25s, 

Dec(J2000) = -9d 28' 42”, 

with an uncertainty of 3 arc-minutes (radius, 90% containment, including
systematic uncertainty). We note that this position is 4 arc-minutes away
from the XRT position, however no other transient is present in the XRT
data inside the BAT error circle, therefore we believe that the BAT and
XRT source are consistent with both being MAXI J1813-095. 

Continuing BAT ground analysis of the source will be available at 
https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/weak/MAXIJ1813-095/

transit, we obtain the source position at

(R.A., Dec) = (273.403 deg, -9.540 deg) = (18 13 36, -09 32 23) (J2000)

with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short
radii of 0.28 deg and 0.21 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long
axis from the north direction is 159.0 deg counterclockwise.  There is
an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius).
The X-ray flux averaged over the 11 scan transits was 23 +- 4 mCrab (4.0-10.0keV,
1 sigma error). 

A quick-look analysis shows that the source flux has increased since the
beginning of 2018 February 19, and reached approximately 30 mCrab at 4-10
keV band on February 20.

Since there is no known X-ray source in the error region, we tentatively
name the source MAXI J1813-095.

Follow-up observations are encouraged to understand the nature of this
new transient.

ATEL #11321,"
We report on the initial analysis of a NuSTAR observation of the new X-ray
transient Swift J1658.2-4242 (GCN #22416, #22417, #22419; ATEL #11306,
#11307, #11310, #11311, #11318).  

NuSTAR observed Swift J1658.2-4242 from 2018-02-16T23:26:09 to 2018-02-17T20:51:09
with a total exposure of 33.3 ks. The time-averaged net count rates are
34.5+/-0.03 cts/s and 32.3+/-0.03 cts/s for FPMA and FPMB, respectively
(~65 mCrab in the NuSTAR band). The continuum spectra measured by NuSTAR
can be approximately described by an absorbed cutoff power-law model with
NH = 1.3 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, photon index of 1.3 and cut-off energy at 53
keV. A disk reflection component with a broad iron line is also required
for a proper fit. 

Two strong dips are found in the NuSTAR light curve separated by ~30ks,
indicating this source could be an eclipsing system. A peak is clearly
detected in the NuSTAR power spectra, with a frequency that increases from
0.138+/-0.002 Hz to 0.166+/-0.003 Hz from the first half to the second
half of the observation (excluding the dips), with FWHM of 3.5e-2+/-6e-3
Hz and 5.0e-2+/-8e-3 Hz, respectively. The features in the power spectrum
are similar to QPOs detected in the hard state of accreting black holes.
And there is no clear indication for pulsations in the NuSTAR data. Therefore
we propose that Swift J1658.2-4242 is a black hole binary.

"
ATEL #11322,"
Swift J1658.2-4242 is a recently detected X-ray transient (GCN #22416,
#22417, ATel #11306). This source has been identified as a potential neutron
star Be/X-ray binary (ATel #11311) or black hole X-ray binary (ATels #11306,
#11321). 

We observed Swift J1658.2-4242 with the Australia Compact Telescope Array
(ATCA) between 2018-02-17 19:48:29.9 UT and 2018-02-18 02:29:09.9 UT (MJD
58166.96 +/- 0.14). The observations were taken at four frequencies, 5.5GHz,
9GHz, 17GHz, and 19GHz, with a bandwidth of 2 GHz at each frequency. We
used 1934-638 for primary flux calibration, and the nearby calibrator 1714-397
(4.65 degrees away) for phase calibration. The data were reduced and imaged
using standard routines in CASA (McMullin et al. 2007). We used a Briggs
weighting robustness of 0 to balance sensitivity with resolution, and minimise
effects from diffuse emission within the field. The array was in its 750B
configuration. We did not include the isolated antenna 6 during imaging.

We significantly detected a radio source at a position consistent with
the Swift X-ray and UVOT position (ATels #11307, #11310). Our best radio
position (measured at 19GHz) is: 

RA (J2000) = 16:58:12.700 +/- 0.004, Dec (J2000) = -42:41:56.09 +/- 0.25
(statistical errors only).  

When fitting a point source in the image plane the measured flux densities
were:  

Frequency (GHz) | Beam Size (arcsec) | Flux Density (mJy)<br/> 
5.5  | 16.9 x 8.3 | 2.35 +/- 0.17 <br/> 
9.0  | 10.5 x 5.2 | 2.17 +/- 0.15 <br/>  
17.0  |  8.0 x 2.5 | 2.27 +/- 0.09 <br/> 
19.0  |  7.2 x 2.2 | 2.30 +/- 0.15  

The radio spectral index of alpha = 0.00 +/- 0.07 (where S_nu &prop; nu<sup>alpha</sup>)
is consistent with a flat radio spectrum from a compact jet. The radio
emission provides a 5-GHz radio luminosity of (8.8 +/- 0.7)*1e29*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup>
erg/s. Based on the Galactic disk and bulge stellar populations (Juric
et al 2008; McMillan 2011), a source along this line of sight has a distance
of 9.0 +7.0/-1.5 kpc (1 sigma confidence interval); adding in a Galactic
halo component would increase the likely distance. 

Swift/XRT observations of the were taken a few hours earlier (between 2018-02-17
10:38:02 UT and 2018-02-17 16:43:58 UT; MJD 58166.57 +/- 0.13). We extracted
the X-ray data using the online XRT pipeline (Evans et al. 2009). The X-ray
data were fit with a highly-absorbed powerlaw model, with an N_H of (1.9
+/- 0.2)E23 cm<sup>-2</sup> and a photon index of 1.6 +/- 0.1, providing
an unabsorbed 1-10 keV X-ray flux of (1.7 +/- 0.2)E-09 erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>.
This X-ray flux corresponds to an X-ray luminosity of (1.30 +/- 0.15)*1e37*(d/8kpc)<sup>2</sup>
erg/s.  

At distances greater than 3kpc, the observed radio and X-ray luminosities
of Swift J1658.2-4242 are consistent with a black hole X-ray binary on
the radio-quiet branch of the L_r/L_x correlation (above all known neutron
star X-ray binaries; see e.g., Tetarenko at al. 2016). Therefore, if the
source is more distant than 3kpc, the strength of the radio emission indicates
that Swift J1658.2-4242 is likely to be a black hole X-ray binary. However,
at closer distances, it could be consistent with a neutron star X-ray binary.
We note that there is only a 0.35% probability that Swift J1658.2-4242
is this close given our Galactic structure calculations along this line
of sight. 

"
ATEL #11318,"
INTEGRAL continued its observations of the new X-ray transient Swift J1658.2-4242
(GCN #22416 and #22417). The source was originally interpreted as a black
hole X-ray binary due to its spectral shape (ATel #11306) but the detection
of a pulsation with Swift (ATel #11311) points towards an accreting X-ray
pulsar interpretation. Previous INTEGRAL observations of the source (ATel
#11306) indicated a possible decrease in X-ray flux above 20 keV. 

The source was at the edge of the IBIS field of view and could thus not
be reliably analyzed during the Galactic Bulge Monitoring campaign (PI
Kuulkers) from 2018-02-16 13:03:15 to 2018-02-16 16:44:50 during INTEGRAL
revolution 1920, i.e., directly following the previous detections. 

From 2018-02-16 17:00:39 to 2018-02-17 07:42:29 during the Galactic Center
monitoring programme (PI Wilms) in INTEGRAL revolution 1920, we detect
the source at: 

15.3\pm0.7 cps or 153 mCrab in 20-40 keV band</br> 
7.1\pm0.6 cps or 130 mCrab in 40-80 keV band 

We use source position for Swift J1658.2-4242 as reported in ATel #11310.
We further use the newest observations of the Crab taken during revolution
1921 (2018-02-17/18) as reference values to convert detected counts to
Crab values.  The source thus appears to have brightened and slightly softened
above 20 keV. However, we caution that inconsistent Crab conversions may
be the reason for some or even most of the difference in reported flux
values. 

On timescales of individual INTEGRAL science windows (~30 min), the source
shows a flux variability of 20-30% in the 20-40 keV band. 

Currently next INTEGRAL observations of the Galactic center region are
scheduled for 2018-02-20-22. We encourage further observations of this
source with other instruments, especially simultaneous to upcoming INTEGRAL
Galactic Center monitoring observations.

ATEL #11313,"		AGN, Black Hole

We report the detection of a large X-ray flare, in a 1ks XRT observation
on 2018-02-17 (00:45UT), originating from the direction of the Galactic
center during regular monitoring observations with Swift (Degenaar+ 2015,
JHEA 7, 137).<br /><br /> 

The source is observed to be variable (0.02 ct/s -- 0.08 ct/s) with an
average count rate of 0.04+/-0.01 ct/s resulting in a total of 40 counts
detected during the observation, facilitating basic spectral fitting. Assuming
a fixed column density of 9.1e22 cm^-2 (Degenaar+ 2015) and fitting with
a power-law in the 2 - 10 keV bandpass, we measure (68% confidence)<br
/> 

Gamma: 1.5 +/- 0.6<br /> 
norm: 0.003 +0.004 -0.002<br /> 

resulting in an absorbed flux of ~ 1e-11 erg/s/cm^2 (2-10 keV), or a luminosity
of ~ 7.7e34 erg/s for an assumed distance of 8 kpc. <br /><br /> 

The position of the source of this flare is nominally consistent with the
position of Sgr A*. The properties of this flare are consistent with previous
detections of flares from Sgr A* as part of the long term Galactic center
monitoring program (Degenaar+ 2013, ApJ, 769, 155). Swift will observe
the GC region again later today as part of the regular monitoring program
(Atel #11263) and significant further evolution will be reported in subsequent
telegrams.<br /><br /> 

Follow-up observations are encouraged to determine the source of this flare.<br
/><br /> 

Our daily Swift X-ray monitoring campaign of the Galactic center will continue
throughout 2018. Updates on new observations are immediately posted at
the Swift Sgr A* Monitoring Campaign website.

ATEL #11316,"
OGLE18be/SN2018be nuclear transient was discovered by the OGLE-IV Transient
Search System (http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle4/transients/ Wyrzykowski
et al. 2014, Acta Astronomica 64, 197) on 2018-01-06. Classification spectrum
was obtained on on 2018-01-16  using  NTT/EFOSC2 (ePESSTO, ATel #11192).
Its quality did not allow for precise classification and redshift estimation.
The spectrum was in fair agreement with strongly reddened Type I SNe. SNID
found matches with various SNe type I at z~0.01 to 0.04 (ATEL #11192).

We obtained an additional spectrum of OGLE18be on 2018-02-01 using the
FOcal Reducer/low dispersion Spectrograph 2 (FORS2) on the Very Large Telescope
(VLT). The spectrum contains mostly the light from the host galaxy and
reminds a Luminous Red Galaxy with apparent absorption line Ca II H & K,
Hbeta and HeI at redshift z=0.151. 

The VLT/FORS spectrum was used to remove the host contribution from the
earlier NTT/EFOSC2 spectrum. 
The spectroscopic classification on the differential spectrum with SNID
code (Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) showed the transient was consistent
with SN Type Ia at maximum, in good agreement with OGLE I-band light curve
shape.  

We thank ESO and VLT staff for the observations. VLT/FORS2 ToO observations
were carried under ESO programme 0100.B-0503(A), PI: Gromadzki.

ATEL #11317,"
We report on behalf of the Swift/XRT Deep Galactic Plane Survey Team: 

We observed the INTEGRAL error region of the X-ray transient source AX
J1620.1-5002 (ATEL# 11252; Lepingwell et al.) for 1 ks with Swift/XRT to
constrain its location. At the reported location of AX J1620.1-5002 we
determine a 3-sigma upper limit of 4.2E-02 counts/s. We detected only one
source, MAXI J1621-501, in the 24' XRT field of view with over 3 sigma
significance above the background (0.3-10 keV). The source count rate was
high, ~2.2 counts/s, so the fluxes reported below have been corrected for
pileup. 

The source spectrum (0.5-10 keV) is well fit both with an absorbed powerlaw
or an absorbed disk blackbody continuum. For the disk blackbody we get
an unabsorbed flux of 7.4 +/- 0.2 E-10 erg/s/cm^2 corresponding to a luminosity
L = 6.2 +/- 1.5 E36 erg/s at the reported distance of 8.4 +/- 2 kpc (Chenevez
et al., ATel 11272). The blackbody temperature is T_in=3.6 +/- 0.4 keV
and the N_H is frozen at 3.7 E22 cm^-2, as derived by our combined analysis
(Gorgone et al., in preparation) of NuSTAR and XRT data (Cstat = 168.75
for 206 degrees of freedom). For the powerlaw we get Cstat = 180.26 with
206 dof, with N_H frozen at 3.7E22 cm^-2, and gamma=1.12 +/- 0.08; the
unabsorbed flux is 8.2E-10 +/- 0.2 erg/s/cm^2 and the luminosity is L =
8.2 +/- 1.7 E36 erg/s. 

Our analysis supports the conclusion by Chenevez et al. (ATEL# 11272),
that the source is most likely MAXI J1621-501 and not AX J1620.1-5002 or
some other source in the field.

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient. 

We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their
continued support of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation through grant GBMF5490 to the Ohio State University,

We report on analysis of all the current Windowed Timing mode data taken
on the newly discovered Galactic Transient, Swift J1658.2-4242 (GCN #22416,
GCN #22417, GCN #22419, ATEL #11310, ATEL #11306, ATEL #11307). We have
performed a broad band periodicity analysis on data totaling an exposure
of 1629s, containing 8093 X-ray events, utilizing a Z<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>
search. We find the most significant peak in the Z<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>
periodogram is at P = 8.7274 +/- 0.0078 s.  

Utilizing the FTOOLS ""powspec"" command, we confirm the presence of the
peak at ~0.115 Hz, with no obvious broadening , suggesting that this is
not a QPO but rather a discrete period. Therefore we suggest that this
period, if real, is the signature that Swift J1658.2-4242 contains a pulsar,
constraining the system type to being likely an accreting pulsar, e.g.
a previously undiscovered Be/X-ray binary system.  

Deeper TOO observations are encouraged in order to confirm the presence
of this period.

We report on NIR photometry of the flat spectrum radio source PKS1244-255,
cross identified with the intermediate redshift quasar CGRaBSJ1246-2547
(z=0.633) and the Gamma-ray source 3FGL1246.7-2547, We observed the source
in the NIR, finding that on January 27th, 2017 (MJD 2458145.970579) its
fluxes corresponded to J = 13.895 +/- 0.03, H = 12.937 +/- 0.02 and Ks
= 12.042 +/- 0.04. Hence, the flux in Ks is  a factor of 3.2 times brighter
than the value previously determined by us on MJD 2457830.87; Ks = 13.296
+/- 0.04. The source is brightest since the time we started monitoring
it on MJD 2454857. Our observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope
of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated by the National Institute for
Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument

ATEL #11310,"
Using the data set from the recent telemetry downlink, 
we report further analysis of the new Galactic transient, Swift J1658.2-4242

(trigger #810300) (Barthelmy et al., GCN Circ. 22416).   

Using the BAT data from T+210 to T+963 sec, the BAT ground-calculated position
is 
RA, Dec = 254.537, -42.712 deg which is 

RA(J2000)  =  16h 58m 08.8s 

Dec(J2000) = -42d 42' 42.1"" 

with an uncertainty of 3.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).

The partial coding was 78%. 

The BAT mask-weighted light curve shows a continuous weak emission  
that starts before and ends after the event data range from T+210 s to
T+963 s. 
Data from the BAT transient monitor (Krimm et al. 2013) show the source

starts flaring around Feb. 14, 2018, and has reached a brightness of ~
70 mCrab 
(15-50 keV). This is generally consistent with the detections reported
by INTEGRAL  
(Grebenev et al., ATEL 11306).   

The BAT time-averaged spectrum from T+210.00 to T+963.02 sec is best fit
by a simple 
power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is

1.98 +- 0.28.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 2.2 +- 0.4 x 10<sup>-6</sup>
erg/cm<sup>2</sup>. 
All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.  

Swift/XRT began observation of the transient at 06:54 UT and observed the
target  
in a mixture of Windowed Timing and Photon Counting mode for a total of
3.1 ks.  
In XRT data we localize the transient, utilizing UVOT to reduce the systematics

on astrometry, to the following coordinates: RA/Dec(J2000) = 254.55266,
-42.69845,  
which is equivalent to: 

RA(J2000) = 16h 58m 12.64s, 

Dec(J2000) = -42d 41m 54.4s, 

with an estimated uncertainty of 1.6 arc-seconds radius (90% confidence).
We note  
that this position lies 0.4 arc-seconds from the IR source VVV J165812.62-424154.78,

from the VISTA Variables DR2 catalog (Minniti et al., 2017), which has
magnitudes  
H=16.2 and K=15.252. In addition G343.2514+00.0537, a source in the GLIMPSE
catalog,  
is also consistent with the XRT localization. 

Spectral fits to the PC and WT data are consistent, although as WT data
are unaffected  
by pile-up we report that fit here. The spectrum is well fit by a highly
absorbed  
power-law model, with N<sub>H</sub> = 1.9 +/- 0.5  10<sup>23</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>,

and photon index = 1.7 +/- 0.5. The average flux, corrected for absorption,

is ~1.6 x 10<sup>-9</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (0.3 - 10 keV). The light-curve
shows  
some evidence of fading during the observed period, although planned later
observations  
of the new transient will be required to determine any fading. 

We find no evidence of pulsations or QPOs in the XRT data, although as
the data are mainly  
taken in PC mode and suffer from pile-up, this does not place strong constraints
on  
the presence of any periodicities in the data.

ATEL #11307,"
A follow-up pointing observation (ObsId:00810300991, 2.8 ks) of the recently
discovered X-ray transient Swift J1658.2-4242 (GCN #22416, #22417) has
been performed by Swift-XRT on MJD 58165.3 in PC mode. It allowed us to
improve the source position using UVOT data to reduce the systematic errors
in telescope pointing (see Goad et al. A&A, 476, 1401, 2007;  Evans et
al.  MNRAS, 397, 1177, 2009): R.A. = 254.55268, Dec. = -42.69847 (=16h
58m 12.64s, -42o 41' 54.5'', epoch 2000.0). The error radius is 1.6'' at
90% confidence. There is a known infrared source VVV J165812.62-424154.78
with Ks magnitude of 15.25 located only 0.4'' off this position. 

The spectrum measured with XRT can be described by a strongly absorbed
power-law with a photon index of 1.2+/-0.3 and NH = 1.5 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}.
The source flux was about 7.2 (+/-0.6) x 10^{-10} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} in
the 0.3-10 keV band that corresponds to the unabsorbed luminosity 1.8 x
10^{37} erg/s at an assumed distance of 10 kpc. The hardness of the spectrum
is consistent with that based on INTEGRAL data (ATEL #11306).  

This work made use of data supplied by the UK Swift Science Data Centre
at the University of Leicester.

ATEL #11306,"
During the on-going INTEGRAL observations of the Galactic center field
performed from 2018 February 13 at 08:06  to February 16 at 13:01 (UTC)
IBIS/ISGRI instrument on board INTEGRAL detected  
the new X-ray transient Swift J1658.2-4242 (GCN #22416 and #22417). 

Due to the large off-axis angle of Swift J1658.2-4242 with respect to the
INTEGRAL pointing direction, the source was only sporadically within the
IBIS/ISGRI field of view. Its 20-60 keV flux measured at different epochs
was:  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time (MJD)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
| Flux (20-60 keV)

58162.47 - 58162.67 | <17 (1 sigma)

58162.93 - 58163.14 |  10+/-8 mCrab

58163.31 - 58163.52 |  32+/-5 mCrab

58164.39 - 58164.56 |  99+/-9 mCrab

58164.81 - 58164.89 | 89+/-21 mCrab

58165.29 - 58165.41 | 41+/-24 mCrab

During the fourth interval (MJD 58164.39-58164.56), we measured the highest
fluxes in two energy bands: 84+/-6 mCrab (20-40 keV) and 97+/-9 mCrab (40-80
keV). This indicates that the source spectrum had a hardness compatible
with the one of the Crab Nebula (photon index 2.1) or slightly harder,
as typical of black-hole binaries in the hard state.  

While measured with large errors the last points in the table let us to
suggest that the hard flux has stabilized or even begins to decrease. This
may be a result of the source transition to another spectral state or the
beginning of its complete switch-off. The source was always outside the
INTEGRAL/JEM-X field-of-view, thus preventing us from verifying this hypothesis
through simultaneous flux measurements in the softer X-ray band. 

Further observations of the source in the soft and hard X-rays, as well
as in other energy domains, are encouraged.

ATEL #11302,"
The MAXI/GSC nova alert system triggered a bright X-ray transient source
at 00:09:17.00 UT  
on 2018 February 2. 
The position of the source was consistent with LMXB 4U 1543-624. 
The X-ray flux averaged over the scan was 938 +- 61 mCrab 
(4.0-10.0keV, 1 sigma error). 
There was no significant excess flux in the previous transit at February
1 22:36 UT  
and in the next transit at February 2 1:42 UT with an upper limit of 20
mCrab for each. 

The light curves in 2-4, 4-10, 10-20 keV bands of the scan transit show

that the spectrum of the source was hard in the beginning and then 
softened at the decay part. The time averaged spectrum is fit by 
blackbody model with kT = 1.8+-0.2 keV. 
Although we could not find any historical report of X-ray burst from 
this source, the observed features are consistent with a type-I X-ray burst.

The 1s peak flux was 4+-1 photons cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in 2-20
keV. 
Assuming the empirical maximum luminosity of X-ray bursts, 3.8 x 10<sup>38</sup>
erg s<sup>-1</sup> 
(Kuulkers et al., 2003, A&A, 399, 663), 
we estimate the upper limit of the source distance as 9.2+-2.3 kpc. 
This is consistent with previous estimation of the distance of ~7 kpc 
(Wang & Chakrabarty, 2004, ApJL, 616, L139).

(1) The spectrum of ASAS-SN18ck is consistent with Type Ia SNe about one
week before maximum light. 
The red continuum of the spectrum can be attributed to line-of-sight reddening
(E(B-V) of about 0.7 mag) .  
The velocity of the ejecta, as measured from SiII 635.5 nm, is around 10300
km/s. 

(2) Good matches are found with normal Type Ia SNe / 91T-like about few
days before maximum light. From the shallow Si II 635.5 nm absorption an
expansion velocity of ~10800 km/s is derived. 

(3) The redshift of the host galaxy is reported by Grogin et al. 1998 (ApJS
119, via NED, z=0.023356 +/- 0.000053) and it is confirmed from the  
measurement of the narrow emission superimposed to the broad Halpha feature.
A good match is obtained with the Type II Plateau SN 2007od (Inserra et
al. 2010, MNRAS 417, 261) two/three weeks after explosion. Along with the
prominent Halpha we identify HeI, Hbeta, Hgamma, Fe II, Sc II, and Ca II
H&K lines. From the position of the P-Cygni absorption of the Hbeta line,
we infer an expansion velocity of ~8400 km/s for the ejected material.

(2) A good match is found with Type Ia SNe one week before maximum light.
The velocity of the ejecta, as measured from SiII 635.5 nm, absorption
is ~13200 km/s. 

Classifications were done with GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488,
383) and SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024). The Asiago classification

We are intensively following StHa 32 both photometrically and 
spectroscopically since 2005.  Its photometric behavior in B band begun
to 
deviate from the P=626 days orbital modulation at the beginning of November

2017.  The initial rise has been very slow, gaining pace with passing time.

The following are some of our most recent measurements:

The brightness gain in B band is already 0.85 mag compare to quiescence

value at the same orbital phase, with all colors turning bluer. 

A low resolution spectrum (3300-8000 Ang, 2.31 Ang/pix) has been obtained
on 
UT Feb 14.8 with the Asiago 1.22m.  Comparing with similar archive spectra

obtained in quiescence at exactly the same orbital phase, the major 
differences are: (1) a brighter and bluer continuum at shorter wavelengths,

with enhanced veiling of the absorption features of the cool giant (in

particular the C2 bands at 4740, 5165 Ang, and the CH band at 4303); (2)
a 
large increase in the integrated absolute flux of all emission lines; (3)
a 
large increase in the ionization degree: HeII 4686/Hbeta changing from
1.45 
to 2.15, HeII 4686/HeI 5016 from 15 to 28, OVI 6825/HeI 6678 from 1.35
to 
2.32.  No obvious nebular line is present (in particular [FeVII] and 
[NeV]).  This is consistent with a high density, density-bounded nebula

increasingly ionized by a now hotter and more luminous WD.  Still, enough

neutral hydrogen survives in the system to be able to efficiently Raman
scatter OVI 1032, 
1036 to observed 6825 and 7088 Ang (the latter 0.38 times the intensity
of 
HeI 7065).

The optically-bright Galactic nova in Musca (CBET #4473, ATel #11183, #11201,

Compact Array (ATCA) on 2018 Feb 5.8 UT. It was detected at 5 sigma at
5 GHz (0.10 mJy), while at 9 GHz it was observed to have a flux density
of 0.22 +/- 0.02 mJy. The radio spectral energy distribution is therefore
consistent with an optically thick, brightening source. More radio observations
are planned, and we encourage observations across the electromagnetic spectrum.

C. Kouveliotou) on Feb. 7, 2018 for 1.9 ks. In the 0.3-10 keV XRT band,
we find a 3 sigma upper limit of 2.0E-02 counts/s using the XIMAGE SOSTA
tool. The field is contaminated by a bright source at ~51' away, likely
LMXB 4U 1642-45.  

Using UVOTCENTROID to analyze UVOT/UVW1 data, we located a source at: RA(J2000)
= 16h 48' 49.635"" and Dec(J2000) = -44d 57' 02.98"" (Uncertainty of +/-
0.42"" at 90% confidence, systematics dominated). This location is 0.27""
from the source position reported in ATEL# 11289 (Strader et al.) and less
than 1"" away with errors considered. Using UVOTDETECT we estimate a source
flux density of 7.1 +/- 0.1E-15 erg/s/cm^2 /angstrom (90% confidence).

Nova Mus 2018 (PNV J11261220-6531086) was discovered by R Kaufman 
on 2018 Jan 14.486, and reported by P. Schmeer in vsnet-alert 21772. 
The first detection was 2018 Jan 3.24 (ASAS-SN, reported in the TOCP).

T.C. Bohlson reported that it is an Fe II nova (ATel #11183). 
It has not yet been detected at radio (Ryder et al., ATel #11212) or X-ray

(Nelson et al., ATel #11220) wavelengths, but Li et al. have reported a
possible 
&gamma;-ray detection (ATel #11201). 

I have been following the nova with the SMARTS Andicam dual channel photometer

in the <em>BVRIJHK</em> bands since JD 2458136.81 (2018 Jan 17). Since
then 
the nova has faded by about 2 mag to <em>V</em>=9.0 on JD 2458162.73, with
little 
change in the optical colors. Between JD 2458155 and 2458157 (at the tender
age of 33 - 35 days) 
the nova started producing dust. 
The K magnitude has decreased by 0.18 mag/day, from <em>K</em>~5.2 to 4.5,

since JD 2458157. 
The brightness in the <em>H</em> band started to increase about 4 days
after the <em>K</em> 
band, and the nova is flat at <em>J</em>. During that time the <em>BVRI</em>
magnitudes 
have faded by about  0.07 mag/day. The <em>B-V</em> color is showing signs
of 
increasing, possibly suggesting the start of a dust dip.

ASASSN-18cs was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-02-13.37 
at V~13.7, and it is also detected in g-band data from the ""Paczynski""

telescope at UT 2018-02-14.38 at g~13.7.  There was a ~120-day

ATEL #11301,"
ASAS-SN 17pf is a newly discovered nova in the LMC (ATel #11132). We have
been monitoring this transient weekly with Swift. The source shows significant
variability in optical and UV bands up to 2 magnitudes.  

Most recent ASAS-SN and Swift/UVOT observations over the last week indicates
a rapid substantial decline. On Feb. 4th, 2018 the source has shown magnitudes
of V=13.25(+/-0.02) as seen by ASAS-SN and UVW1=13.76(+/-0.02), UVW2=14.13(+/-0.02),
and UVM2=14.02(+/-0.02) in Swift filters. However in observations performed
between Feb. 10th and 12th, 2018 the source shows magnitudes of V=15.08(+/-0.06),
UVW1=14.76(+/-0.02), UVW2=14.857(+/-0.02) and UVM2=14.84(+/-0.03), indicating
a ~2 magnitude decline in V band over a week (all magnitudes in AB magnitude).

We have also looked at Swift/XRT images (all taken in PC mode) to search
for a possible X-ray counterpart. Stacking all the available Swift observations
of this source (taken since the discovery, in early December 2017) provides
a total exposure of ~20 ks. We find no evidence of an X-ray counterpart
for this source and estimate a 95% upper limit of 7.5e-4 ct/s on Swift/XRT
count rate in the 0.3-10 keV band. Assuming a power law spectrum with photon
index of 2, hydrogen column density of 7.4e20 cm^-2 for this direction
(Dickey and Lockman, 1990, ARA&A, 28, 215), and a distance of ~49 kpc (to
LMC, e.g., see Pietrzynski et al. 2013, Nature, 495, 76), gives an upper
limit of 9.5e33 erg/s on X-ray luminosity. 

Observations across the spectrum are encouraged. Further UV and optical
observations are planned. We thank the Swift team for scheduling our observations.

We report on SALT spectroscopy of transient Gaia18aeo/AT2018ig, discovered
by Gaia Science Alerts program on 2018-01-17. The transient was detected
in the nucleus of the host galaxy LEDA 634652. A low resolution (R = 350)
SALT/RSS spectra was taken on 2018-02-09, under the SALT Large Programme
on transients (2016-2-LSP-001). 

The spectroscopic classification was done using SNID code (Blondin & Tonry
2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) and it was matched to SN Type Ia at about 3 weeks
past maximum. Spectrum shows narrow emission Halpha line and also broad
HeI present due to host galaxy and corresponds to redshift z=0.086. Gaia
photometric measurement at the moment of observation and at this redshift
corresponds to absolute magnitude of about -19.79 mag which is consistent
with Type Ia.

We report optical spectroscopic observations of nova ASASSN-18ca (ATel
#11275) on Feb 9.58 UT. The spectrum was obtained using the HFOSC instrument
mounted on the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) of the Indian Astronomical
Observatory, Hanle, India, in the 380-850nm wavelength range.  Prominent
emission features are the hydrogen Balmer lines, Fe II lines (multiplets
27, 42, 74), and OI line at 7773 Angstroms. The FWHM velocity of the H-alpha
and H-beta lines were measured to be ~2500 km/s and ~ 2250 km/s, respectively.
We confirm ASASSN-18ca is an Fe II type classical nova eruption in M31.

PNV J16484962-4457032 was discovered by H. Nishimura on UT 2018 Feb 6.86.
Subsequent spectroscopy of this transient by S. Kiyota on 2018 Feb 7.73
was consistent with an identification as a classical nova. We obtained
a spectrum of this source with the Goodman Spectrograph on the SOAR telescope
on 2018 Feb 12.39, covering a wavelength range of about 3800-7800 A at
a resolution of 5.8 A. The spectrum shows broad Balmer emission, with an
Halpha FWHM of about 3000 km/s and Hbeta FWHM of about 1850 km/s. There
are many Fe II lines and strong O I at 7773, which indicate a classification
as a nova of the Fe II class. The nova is highly reddened, consistent with
its low Galactic latitude of b=-0.06.

We report on high-resolution spectroscopy of PNV J16484962-4457032, confirmed
by J. Strader et al. (ATel #11289) as a Fe II-type nova, obtained on 2018
February 12.1 (UTC, HJD 2458161.6), using the High Resolution Spectrograph
(HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE, 91476) on the Southern African Large
Telescope (SALT). Observations were taken in the LR mode of HRS, covering
a spectral range of 3800-8900&#8491; at a resolution of R ~ 14,000. The
data were reduced with the SALT HRS MIDAS pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016,
MNRAS 459, 3068). 

The spectrum is dominated by emission lines of H I, Fe II, O I, Na I, Al
II, Ca II, Mg I and Mg II (see below a full list of the line identifications).
We note the absence of P Cygni absorption in the spectrum. The lines have
rounded profiles with a FWHM of around 1700 &plusmn; 100 km/s (for H&#945;
and H&#946;). The emission lines and their profiles are characteristic
of classical novae of the Fe II spectroscopic class. 

We can identify the interstellar Na I (D1) and (D2) absorption features.
These lines have EW(D2) = 1.3 &plusmn; 0.05&#8491; and EW(D1) = 1.1 &plusmn;
0.05&#8491;. Using the empirical relations of Poznaski et al. 2012 (MNRAS,
426, 1465), we derive E(B-V) = 9.66 &plusmn; 1.7 and Av ~ 30.0 &plusmn;
1.7 towards the nova, consistent with the high extinction towards the nova
from the Galactic reddening maps.

ATEL #11286,"
We report the following spectroscopic classifications for the transients
detected by the Tsinghua-NAOC Transient Survey (SN 2018pr and SN 2018pt).
All spectra were obtained on UT 2018 Feb. 9.7 with the 2.4 m telescope
(LJT+YFOSC) at Lijiang Observatory of Yunnan Observatories. Based on the
spectral comparison tools SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024)
the classifications were given as: 

(1) The spectrum of SN 2018pr contaminated by the host galaxy matches with
the normal type Ia supernova SN 2007ca at t = +9 days relative to the maximum
light. Given a redshift of 0.092 for its host galaxy (From narrow Ha emission
in spectrum), an expansion velocity of about 10000 km/s can be deduced
from the Si II 635.5 absorption minimum. The classification spectrum is
posted on the IAU Transient Name Sever: https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018pr.

(2) The spectrum of SN 2018pt matches with the 91T-like type Ia supernova
SN 2005eq at t = -4 days relative to the maximum light. Given a redshift
of 0.127 (from SNID fit) for its host galaxy, an expansion velocity of
about 9300 km/s can be deduced from the Si II 635.5 absorption minimum,
and the absolute brightness of this SN is about -20.2 mag. The classification
spectrum is posted on the IAU Transient Name Sever: https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018pt.

ATEL #11287,"
We report on high-resolution spectroscopy of nova Cir 2018 obtained on
2018 January 29.45, 30.44, and February 2.47 (UTC) using the High Resolution
Spectrograph (HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc. SPIE, 91476) mounted on the
Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). Observations were taken in the
HR mode of HRS, covering a spectral range of 3800-8900 &#8491; at a resolution
of R = 65000-67000. The data were reduced with the SALT HRS MIDAS pipeline
(Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068). The nova has been classified as
an Fe II-class nova (ATel #11209), showing emission features of H I and
Fe II.  

The first HRS spectrum obtained was dominated by P Cygni features of H
I, Fe II (42, 46, 55, 74), O I, Ca II, Na I, Al II, Mg I, N I, and N II
(see below a full list of the line identification), with very faint Balmer
emission features. The P Cygni absorption components were at ~ -500 &plusmn;
50 km/s with a FWHM of ~ 300 km/s. The very faint emission features were
slightly red shifted (~ +30 km/s) and characterized by a red emission wing
extending to more than 500 km/s. Also present are relatively broad Ca II
H & K at -500 km/s with a FWHM ~ 1050 km/s. The near-absence of emission
lines in the spectrum indicates that, at this stage, the nova is around
maximum light. This is consistent with the AAVSO photometric measurements.

In the second spectrum the absorption features have weakened, with some
having disappeared, while the emission features have strengthened. These
emission features, except for the Balmer lines, are now double-peaked,
with a main peak at ~ +30 km/s and another at ~ +400 km/s.  

The third spectrum was dominated by strong emission lines while the P Cygni
absorption features have faded considerably. Both the emergence of strong
emission lines and the fading of the absorption features indicate that
the nova has started the decline from maximum, which is also consistent
with photometric data. In addition to the pre-existed lines, more lines
also appear in emission such as N II and forbidden O I lines. 

Besides the Na I (D) blue-shifted absorption features, which are intrinsic
to the nova, we can also identify the interstellar Na I (D1) and (D2) absorption
features. These lines have EW(D2) = 0.58 &plusmn;  0.01 &#8491; and EW(D1)
= 0.46 &plusmn;  0.01 &#8491;. Using the empirical relations of Poznaski
et al. 2012 (MNRAS, 426, 1465), we derive E(B-V) = 0.23 &plusmn;  0.05
and Av = 0.71 &plusmn;  0.05 towards the nova.

In ATEL #11284 we report a wrong target IAU name in the table. The AT2018nw
(=ATLAS18lww), which was classified as a Type II supernova, should read
AT2018nq (=ATLAS18lww). We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this

ATEL #11279,"
We report the discovery of the photometric variability of GSC 66-869 in
SA 95. Its J2000 coordinates from GSC are: R.A. = 03h 53m 17.72s   Decl.
= +00° 04' 22.4"", about 3' NW of the variable FASTT89 = SA 95-107 whose
periodicity we detected too.  
GSC 66-869 has V = 13.6 from APASS, and its amplitude from our data is
about 0.11 mag. We discovered its variability by means of 2751 unfiltered
CCD frames taken in a range of 63 days with the 0.25-m f/10 telescope of
OAMH. Differential CCD aperture photometry was performed using Landolt's
standard SA95-101 in the same field. 
GSC 66-869, although having measurements in ASAS-SN, CSS, NSVS and TASS,
is not listed as variable in the following catalogs: GCVS, AAVSO-VSX, ASAS-SN,
Catalina sky surveys, Linear survey, NSVS, SDSS stripe 82, ASAS, TASS,
MOTESS-GNAT, SuperWASP, DIRBE and on many IBVS and OEJV. 
Our time series shows a smooth intra-night variability with some dips,
and a peculiar inter-nights variability with minima (apart from dips) switching
state from deeper and sinusoidal to less deep and flat. 
We have analyzed our time series of GSC 66-869 with the software Period
04, PerSea 2.6 and ATSA (Santangelo et al., 2007, AN 328, 55) using many
algorithms. 
We have found a periodicity P1 = 0.67254 ± 0.00007 d with p-value << 0.001,
but our data can be very well phased by the P2 = 2*P1 = 1.34508 d period
too. We have found confirmation of the same two alternative periods from
our time series analysis of ASAS-SN data. We have not found significant
periodicities in CSS data. In NSVS data there could be a marginal detection
of a 1-day alias of 1/P1. 
If the period is P1, there is one dip on the rising branch of our phased
light curve of GSC 66-869 and this dip has shape, duration and depth very
similar to the transient flux dips in EPIC 205046529B or in RIK 210; according
to Stauffer et al. (2017 AJ 153, 152) these dips could be due to orbiting
clouds of material. Our alternative hypotheses for the dip are a disk,
or rings of debris, or streams, or the transit of a dark body like a brown
dwarf. From our data we derived a linear time-shift (about 1.7 minutes/day)
of the time of the minimum of the dip. 
If the period is P1, apart from the dip, the light curve shows the above
mentioned switching states of minima, with a slightly longer rise and shorter
fall of the light curve resembling some peculiar radial pulsators like
V2551 Cyg (Kjurkchieva et al. 2017, RAA 17, 69) or some peculiar HADS or
RRc. 
If the period is P1 with the flat minimum state, then the light curve resembles
that of the DSCT V116 in NGC 6791 (Hartman et al. 2005, AJ 130, 2241),
but a period of 0.67254 d is too long for a DSCT. 
If the period is P2, then the light curve strongly resembles that of an
EB or EW eclipsing binary with the peculiarities of two dips shifted each
other by 0.5 phases and the primary minimum that shows a change in its
depth; on the early nights of our observed time span the primary minimum
was deeper and sinusoidal, but on subsequent nights it suddenly changed
to very flat (constant within 0.01 magnitudes) and with the same depth
of the secondary minimum. 
If the period is P2, then the state with the deep sinusoidal minimum resembles
an EB lightcurve, instead the state with the flat minimum resembles an
EW lightcurve of an extreme mass ratio binary (EMRB) like V857 Her (Qian
et al. 2005, AJ 130, 1206) perhaps with a very small q parameter. A period
of 1.34508 d is still border-line for an EW, but it is fully compatible
with an EB or RS. 
From APASS BVg'r'i' and 2MASS JHK we got the observed colour indexes; e.g.
(B-V)=0.937. From NED database we got Av = 0.786; so, if the ratio of total
to selective extinction is 3.1, then  E(B-V) = 0.254; so (B-V)o = 0.683.
No spectra of GSC 66-869 are available from SDSS. The spectral class estimated
from colour indexes corrected for interstellar extinction is G5 V or G1
III, so it would be compatible with an EB or EW, but not with a DSCT nor
a RRc.

Using Fermi/GBM data between MJD 58098 and 58154 (2017 December 11 to 2018
February 5) in the 12-50 keV range, we determine a new orbital ephemeris
for the newly discovered (ATEL #10809) Be X-ray binary Swift J0243.6+6124.
Pulsed searches using the ephemeris from M. Ge et al. (ATEL #10907) and
V. Doroshenko et al. 2017 resulted in superfluous structure to the torque
model that was correlated with the orbital period likely related to a residual
orbital signature.  This new orbital ephemeris results in orbit corrected
frequency derivatives that correlate well with corrected Swift/BAT rates
and Fermi/GBM pulsed flux.  The Fermi/GBM pulsed flux and frequency history
may be viewed at: https://gammaray.msfc.nasa.gov/gbm/science/pulsars/lightcurves/swiftj0243.html.

We obtain the following orbital parameters: orbital period ~ (27.587 +/-
0.017) days, semi-major axis ~ (115.84 +/- 0.32) light-seconds, eccentricity
~ (0.09848 +/- 0.00042), longitude of periastron ~ (-73.56 +/- 0.16) degrees,
and periastron epoch (JD) ~ (2458103.629 +/- 0.017).

with a library 
of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; 
Blondin and Tonry 2007, Ap.J., 666, 1024) shows that it matches with

NuSTAR observed NGC 300 on UT 2018-01-31T01:23:50 -- 2018-02-01T06:39:02.
We used the cleaned event files provided by HEASARC, ran barycorr to refer
the times to the Solar System Barycenter, and filtered a region of 30""
around the transient source. 
We used HENDRICS (github.com/stingraysoftware/HENDRICS) to perform a pulsation
search. 
We calculated the periodogram, and detected a peak at ~0.05 Hz. 
We refined the analysis running a Z^2 search (Buccheri et al. 2003) around
this frequency, and found a peak incompatible with a constant frequency
(using the criterion of Leahy et al. 1987). We searched over frequency
and frequency derivative, and we measured a strong spin up compatible with
the general spin up trend of the source (ATEL #11158, ATEL #11174, ATEL
#11179, ATEL #11229). 
We calculated the pulse TOAs using Stingray (github.com/stingraysoftware/Stingray)
and refined the timing solution using PINT (https://github.com/nanograv/PINT)
and TEMPO2 (http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/tempo2/), obtaining
consistent results. Below we quote, for each parameter, the higher uncertainty
value obtained between the two fits. 

The timing solution is 

PEPOCH    MJD 58149.058221232100000 
F0        0.05006052(42) x 10^-7 Hz 
F1        4.38(24) x 10^-12 Hz / s 

which corresponds to 

P0 = 19.9758(2) s   
P1 = -1.75(9) x 10^-7 s/s 

We do not find significant evidence for an orbital modulation.

ATEL #11283,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed increasing gamma-ray emission from a source
positionally consistent with the flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 0226-559
(also known as PMN J0228-5546, CGRaBS J0228-5546 and 3FGL J0228.3-5545)
with radio coordinates (J2000) R.A.: 37.09004 deg, Dec.: -55.76764 deg
(Fey et al. 2015, AJ, 150, 58). This blazar has a high redshift, z=2.471
(Mahony et al. 2011, MNRAS, 417, 2651). 

PKS 0226-559 has brightened in GeV gamma rays since the beginning of January
2018. Preliminary analysis indicates that on February 6, 2018, PKS 0226-559
was in a flaring state with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100 MeV)
of (0.8+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only),
about 35 times greater than its four-year average flux reported in the
third Fermi-LAT source catalog (3FGL, Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23).
The corresponding photon spectral index (E>100 MeV) of 2.1+/-0.2 (statistical
uncertainty only) is smaller than the 3FGL catalog value of 2.43+/-0.06.

PKS 0226-559 continued to be detected on a  daily basis on February 7 and
8, 2018, with daily averaged gamma-ray fluxes (E>100 MeV) respectively
of (0.3+/-0.1) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 and (0.4+/-0.1) X 10^-6 photons
cm^-2 s^-1. The corresponding photon spectral indexes (E>100 MeV) of 1.8+/-0.2
and 1.9+/-0.2 suggest a rather hard spectral state during the current flaring
state. 

This is the first time that an increasing gamma-ray flux for this source
has been announced by the Fermi LAT Collaboration, after almost 9.6 years
of Fermi LAT all-sky survey observations. The source was also reported
in a flaring state in the optical band on January 22, 2018 by MASTER Net
(ATel#11225). 

Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring
of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity
of this source, we encourage multiwavelength observations. For this source
the Fermi LAT contact person is S. Ciprini (stefano.ciprini@ssdc.asi.it).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

ATEL #11275,"
During the ongoing All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN or
""Assassin""), using data from the quadruple 14-cm ""Leavitt"" telescope in
Fort Davis, Texas, we discovered a new transient source, most likely a
nova, in the nearby galaxy M31. 

ASASSN-18ca (AT 2018pp) was discovered in images obtained on UT 2018-02-08.07
at g~16.5 mag. We do not detect (g>18.6) the object in images taken on
UT 2018-02-06.12 and before. Images obtained on 2018-02-08 by J. Brimacombe
confirm the discovery of the transient.  

The position of ASASSN-18ca is approximately 4543"" South and 148"" West
from the center of M31 (d=784 kpc, Stanek & Garnavich 1998, ApJ, 503, L131),
giving an absolute g-band magnitude of approximately -8.2 (m-M=24.5, A_g=0.205).
Properties of the new source and photometry are summarized in the tables
below:

2018-02-08.07	 16.5 

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient. 

We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their
continued support of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation through grant GBMF5490 to the Ohio State University,
NSF grant AST-1515927, the Mt. Cuba Astronomical Foundation, the Center

IGR J17091-3624 is a recurrent transient source, and a strong black 
hole candidate.  The source has shown many of the same X-ray timing 
behaviors and ""states"" as GRS 1915+105 (e.g., Altamirano et al. 2011, 
Court et al. 2017), as well as relativistic disk reflection and strong

winds (Reis et al. 2012, Xu et al. 2017; King et al. 2012).  However, 
even close to outburst peak, IGR J17091-3624 is much fainter than GRS 
1915+105; its outbursts are difficult to detect in the Neil Gehrels 
Swift Observatory BAT.

Based on suggestive recent BAT activity, an XRT exposure was obtained 
on 2018 Feb 02, starting at 17:49:53 UT.  A net exposure of 970s was 
obtained in ""photon counting"" mode.  The source is clearly detected in

this exposure: 43 total counts are recorded, with an estimated local 
background of 4 counts.  Assuming an interstellar column density of 8 
E+21 cm^-2 and a power-law with an index of Gamma = 2, this 
corresponds to a flux of approximately 2 E-12 erg/cm2/s (0.3-10 keV). 
The distance to IGR J17091-3624 is quite uncertain; for a distance of 
8.5 kpc, this flux implies a luminosity of L = 3.4 E+34 erg/s; for a 
distance of 25 kpc (Altamirano et al. 2011), the flux implies a 
luminosity of L = 3.0 E+35 erg/s.

We note that the XRT image is contaminated by mirror rings induced by 
the nearby bright X-ray source GX 349+2.  Source and background 
regions avoided these rings.

Further monitoring may be able to determine whether the source is in a

""hard state"" outburst, or if it is rising toward a full outburst. 
This source may be of particular appeal for X-ray timing studies.  The

similarity of its QPO frequencies, power spectra, and flux states to 
those observed in GRS 1915+105 poses an interesting dilemma: either 
the two sources have remarkably similar black hole masses and spins, 
or the observed phenomena and frequencies are set by aspects of the 
accretion flow but not anchored by gravity.

We performed the spectroscopic observations of SN 2018pv using the 1.5-m
Kanata telescope  
attached with the Hiroshima One-shot Wide-field Polarimeter (HOWPol; Kawabata
et al. 2008) 
on Feb 8.7. This SN was discovered at 15.1 mag on Feb. 3 by the amateur
astronomer M. Tsuboi, Hiroshima, Japan. The spectrum resembles with that
of a normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) at the pre-maximum stage. Using the
automatic SN classification tool, GELATO (Harutyunyan et al., 2008, A&A,
488, 383), the spectrum would be similar to that of SN 1992A at the 5 days
before maximum. We identified the absorption lines of the CaII IR triplet,
OI 7774, SiII 6355, SiII 5972, SII W-shape feature, and Fe II multiplet
in our spectrum. The CaII IR triplet, OI 7774, and SiII 6355 line velocities
were measured to be ~16500, ~16500, and ~13000 km/s, respectively. The
SiII 5972 absorption line was significantly deeper than that of SN 1992A,
suggesting that this SN might be a more subluminous event. We measured
the equivalent width (EW) of the NaID line as to 0.9 angstrom, suggesting
that the host galactic extinction could be very large (A_V~0.5-2.0). Even
if the extinction is corrected for, this SN could be still in the rising
phase. Follow-up observations could be encouraged.

We report the following spectroscopic classifications for the transients
detected by the Tsinghua-NAOC Transient Survey (SN 2018pc and SN 2018pn)
and All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASASSN-18bt = SN 2018oh).
All spectra were obtained on UT 2018 Feb. 7.7 with the 2.4 m telescope
(LJT+YFOSC) at Lijiang Observatory of Yunnan Observatories. Based on the
spectral comparison tools SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024)
the classifications were given as: 

(1) The spectrum of SN 2018pc matches with the normal type Ia supernova
SN 2004fz at t = -7 days relative to the maximum light. Given a redshift
of 0.009 for its host galaxy, an expansion velocity of about 11500 km/s
can be deduced from the Si II 635.5 absorption minimum; 

(2) The spectrum of SN 2018pn matches with the type IIP supernova SN 2004dj
at t = +0 days relative to the maximum light. Given a redshift of 0.048
(from SNID fit) for its host galaxy, an expansion velocity of about 5500
km/s can be deduced from the Ha absorption minimum; 

(3) The spectrum of ASASSN-18bt (= SN 2018oh) matches with the normal type
Ia supernova SN 2003du at t = -8 days relative to the maximum light. Given
a redshift of 0.012 for its host galaxy, an expansion velocity of about
11000 km/s can be deduced from the Si II 635.5 absorption minimum.

The radio quasar PKS 0346-27 has been detected by Fermi-LAT in a very bright
state (Angioni et al. ATel #11251) on February 2, 2018. I could observe
the source with the REM Telescope at La Silla on February 7 (MJD 58156.08)
in the r,i (Sloan), and J,H (Johnson) filters. Comparison stars were taken
from the UCAC4 catalog for the r,i bands and 2MASS for the J,H bands. 

The following magnitudes were measured: r=16.63+-0.07, i=16.12+-0.10,
J=14.68 +-0.07, and H=13.85 +-0.06.  
The quasar is therefore now about 2 magnitudes brighter than the 2MASS
values, J=16.77 and H=16.31. 

Optical, non simultaneous, DSS values from GSC2.3.2, converted to the r
and i bands, were r=19.51 and i=14.76. In the USNO-B1 it is reported in
the photographic N band (Cousins I) as faint as 18.45 indicating a large
historic variability range. 

It is likely that PKS0346-27 was even brighter at the time of the Gamma-ray
flare. Monitoring with REM will continue in the next days.

In the complete mosaicked images of ISGRI and JEM-X data, we do not detect
the source. We set an upper limit (5 &sigma; confidence level) on the average
persistent flux of 3.1e-11 erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> in the 20 - 40 keV IBIS/ISGRI
band and 2.6e-10 erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (effective exposure 17 ks) in the
3 - 10 keV JEM-X band (effective exposure 13 ks). This is consistent with
the Swift/XRT fluxes reported in ATel #11264. 
The source is not detected on a timescale of individual INTEGRAL pointings
(about 1 hour), with a typical 5-sigma upper limit of 2.6e-10 erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup>(20
- 40 keV).

ATEL #11272,"
During INTEGRAL observation of the Norma Region (revolution 1915) on February
3<sup>rd</sup>, 2018, a thermonuclear X-ray burst was detected by the JEM-X
instruments at 21:51:08 UTC with a rise time of about 2s and a decay time
of almost 40s as measured between 3-25 keV. The position of the burst (RA=245.09,
Dec=-50.03; 2 arcmin error radius) on the JEM-X image is consistent with
MAXI J1621-501 (ATel #10869, #10874), which has already  been recorded
as an X-ray burster (ATel #11067).

Considering that INTEGRAL cannot distinguish MAXI J1621-501 from AX J1620.1-5002
only separated by about 2 arcminutes, this suggests that the source which
is currently seen active by INTEGRAL (ATel #11252) is MAXI J1621-501.

The source flux is measured with the following higher values compared to
the previous INTEGRAL revolution (ATel #11252):

3-10 keV: 24 &plusmn;1 mCrab,

10-25 keV: 23 &plusmn;5 mCrab,

22-60 keV: 22.5 &plusmn;1.3 mCrab

The JEM-X light curves show a structure consistent with a photospheric
radius expansion burst reaching the Eddington luminosity. The burst peak
flux is measured at 1.5 &plusmn;0.3 Crab between 3-25 keV corresponding
to an estimated unabsorbed bolometric flux of (4.1 &plusmn;1)&times;10<sup>-8</sup>
erg/cm<sup>2</sup>/s. We thus derive a source distance of 8.4 &plusmn;2
kpc using the standard candle burst luminosity (L<sub>Edd</sub> = 3.8&times;10<sup>38</sup>
erg/s) from Kuulkers et al. 2003; A&A 399, 663.

A similar X-ray burst is again detected from the same position during INTEGRAL
revolution 1916 at 2018-02-06T03:42:05. At that time the average source
fluxes are measured at 30 &plusmn;2 mCrab between 3-25 keV and 40.3 &plusmn;1.5
mCrab between 22-60 keV.

On 2018 February 6, INTEGRAL resumed its monitoring program of the Galactic
bulge mainly in the 3-100 keV band (see ATel #438; Kuulkers et al. 2007,
A&A, 466, 595). The total exposure of the <a href=""http://integral.esac.esa.int/BULGE/REVS/1916.html"">first
observation</a> was about 11 ks. The X-ray transients IGR J17329-2731 and
GRS 1747-312 were seen to be active by JEM-X.  

IGR J17329-2731 was discovered in August 2017 (ATels #10644, #10645, #10682),
and is possibly a symbiotic binary (ATel #10685). It has been active since
then (Bozzo et al. 2018, submitted). We find it is faint, with a detection
significance of about 3 sigma in the mosaic, i.e., close to the detection
limit of JEM-X. We derive fluxes of 5.5 +/- 2.7 mCrab and 11 +/- 5 mCrab
in the 3-10 keV and 10-25 keV energy bands, respectively. GRS 1747-312
is a frequently recurring neutron-star binary X-ray transient in the globular
cluster Terzan 6 (see, e.g., in 't Zand et al. 2003, A&A 406, 233); we
find it at 31 +/- 4 mCrab (3-10 keV) and 14 +/- 9 mCrab (10-25 keV). 

No significantly active X-ray transients were seen with IBIS/ISGRI, down
to a limit of about 20 mCrab (i.e., about 1e36 erg/s at 8 kpc) in the 18-40
keV band. 

Further observations of the Galactic bulge within the program are foreseen
in the coming months, as well as other INTEGRAL observations aimed at the
Galactic Center, see http://integral.esac.esa.int/isocweb/schedule.html?action=schedule&startRevno=1917&endRevno=1950.

Quan-Zhi Ye (Caltech/IPAC) on behalf of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)
and the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH)
announces the first detection and follow-up of a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA)
detected by the new small NEA detection pipeline of the ZTF/GROWTH projects
(developed and running at IPAC).  

ZTF has recently begun preliminary science observations and includes a
dedicated pipeline for detecting small (< 150 meter) trailed NEAs.  Once
a detection is made and submitted to the Minor Planet Center (MPC), follow-up
can be initiated at observatories around the world, including those involved
with the GROWTH project.  Same night or next night observations are highly
advantageous as trailed asteroids have high angular rates, on order of
1""/second or larger, and therefore are only observable for a few days.

On the first night of operation (5 Feb 2018) the ZTF fast response small
NEA pipeline detected a bright trailed object in 4 r-band images taken
over ~2 hours.  This yielded 8 endpoint observations of the object, which
were submitted to the MPC.  Follow-up observations were made by other observatories
(MPC circular: MPEC 2018-C23) and the object was designated as 2018 CL
by the MPC.  2018 CL was first detected at a distance of about 3 times
the Earth-Moon distance and had a closest approach of about 2.4 Earth-Moon
distances on Feb 6 4:09 UTC.  The NEA had a measured H magnitude of 25.5,
and a V magnitude at closest approach of brighter than 15. The size of
the asteroid is nominally 50 meters assuming an albedo of 5%. Fifty-six
observations of the object were made worldwide in less than 20 hours, providing
a well determined orbit. It is a probable Aten asteroid.  Low-resolution
spectroscopic observations were made the night following the initial detection,
6 Feb 2018, with the robotic Palomar 60” telescope using the SEDM instrument
(resolution R~100). 

We acknowledge the valuable and timely follow-up observations of 2018 CL
by astronomers around the world. Additional follow-up observations with
higher spectral resolution are encouraged before the asteroid is too far
away from the earth. 

ZTF is a project led by PI S. R. Kulkarni at the California Institute of
Technology, (see ATEL #11266).  GROWTH is led by PI Mansi Kasliwal at the
California Institute of Technology. This work was supported by the <a href=""http://growth.caltech.edu/"">

ATEL #11263,"
On 2018 February 4, Swift resumed its daily monitoring campaign of the
Galactic center using the X-ray telescope (Degenaar et al. 2015, JHEA 7,
137; see link below). There are currently no active X-ray transients seen
within the ~20x20 arcmin region around Sgr A* that is covered by our campaign.
The sensitivity limit of a single 1-ks XRT exposure corresponds to a luminosity
of ~1E+34 erg/s at a distance of 8 kpc.  

Before the Galactic center became Sun-constrained, there were two X-ray
transients active; the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GRS 1741-2853
had been active since 2017 October 11 (ATel #10859) and starting on 2017
October 19 we detected activity of a very-faint X-ray transient near Sgr
A* that was most likely associated with the neutron star LMXB AX J1745.6-2901
(ATel #10900). Both objects were still detected during the last observation
of 2017, performed on November 2.  

GRS 1741-2853 was still fairly bright on 2017 November 2; a spectrum extracted
with the online XRT products tools (Evans et al. 2007, A&A 469, 379; 2009,
MNRAS 397, 1177) can be fitted with an absorbed power-law model with an
index of 3.7+/-1.5 and a hydrogen column density of (3.4 +/- 1.3)E+23 cm-2
(1-sigma errors, assuming wilm abundances and vern cross-sections for the
absorption model tbabs). The resulting unabsorbed 2-10 keV flux is (1.1
+/- 1.0)E-10 erg/cm2/s, which implies a luminosity of ~7E+35 erg/s at 7.2
kpc (Trap et al. 2009, A&A 504, 501). This is over an order of magnitude
fainter than earlier on during the outburst, when it was detected at ~1E+37
erg/s (ATel #10859), and may suggest that the outburst was ceasing. The
detection on 2017 November 2 implies a minimum outburst duration of 3 weeks,
whereas the non-detection on 2018 February 4 limits the maximum length
of this outburst of GRS 1741-2853 to 16.5 weeks. 

AX J1745.6-2901 was detected at a count rate of ~4E-2 c/s during the observation
of 2017 November 2, which is too faint to extract a spectrum but implies
a similar brightness as the two proceeding weeks, i.e. a luminosity of
a few times 1E+35 erg/s at a distance of 8 kpc (ATel #10900). This detection
implies that this outburst of AX J1745.6-2901 had a minimum length of 

2 weeks. The non-detection in our new 2018 February 4 observation sets
a limit on the maximum outburst duration of 15.5 weeks. 

Our daily Swift X-ray monitoring campaign of the Galactic center will continue
throughout 2018. Updates on new observations are immediately posted at
the <A HREF=http://www.swift-sgra.com>Swift Sgr A* Monitoring Campaign

On 2018 February 5 at 19:27:11 UT, Swift BAT detected a new burst from
a direction 
consistent with the magnetar CXOU J164710.2-455216 (trigger=808755; Barthelmy
et al. 
2018, GCN #22389). Moreover, INTEGRAL detected two short bursts from CXOU
J1647 on 2018  
February 6 at 07:25:58 UT and 12:33:36 UT. 
The source was recovering from a major outburst, started 
on 2017 May 16 (trigger=753085; D'Ai et al. 2017, GCN #21095), when it
reached 
a 0.5-10 keV absorbed X-ray flux of 8(+2)(-4)e-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2, 
a factor of about 10 larger than the quiescent value.  

The XRT began observing the field about 40 s after the BAT trigger for
an exposure time of 1.2 ks.  
The time-averaged spectrum could be well described by an absorbed power
law  
with a photon index of 1.8(3) and a column density of 3.1(7)e22 cm^-2 

(errors are quoted at 1sigma confidence level; see also Barthelmy et al.
2018, GCN #22389).  
The source had an averaged count rate of about 0.3 cts/s in the energy
band 0.5-10 keV,  
corresponding to an absorbed flux of 2.3(2)e-11 erg s^-1 cm^-2.  

We note that the light curve was highly variable and  
at the end of the observation (about 10 minutes after the trigger) the
absorbed  
0.5-10 keV flux was approximately 1.2(+0.1)(-0.4)e-11 erg s^-1 cm^-2, 

substantially higher than in the last Swift observation performed before
the event, on 2018 January 28 when it was around 2e-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2.

We are monitoring the source since its outburst onset in 2017 May with
Swift, Chandra and NuSTAR  
observations (ATEL #10878). Swift observations are already planned till
the end of February, and new simultaneous Chandra and NuSTAR observations
will be performed within the next two weeks.

Following ATel#11223 and ATel#11233, we performed optical spectroscopic

at Rozhen NAO, Bulgaria. Our observations show that the H-alpha emission
line is variable between -70 km/s and +200 km/s, similar to the previous
spectra (Fig.1). The equivalent width of the H-alpha emission line is about
44 &Aring;.

We observed MWC 148 in B and V bands on the night of 2018 Jan 26 with the
50/70cm Schmidt telescope at Rozhen NAO. We obtained the following magnitudes
&mdash; in B band 9.66 &plusmn; 0.05 and in V band 9.12 &plusmn; 0.04,

We report on a new NIR flare of the high redshift QSO (z=1.213) [hb89]0234+285
also known as BZQJ0237+2848, cross correlated with the radio source 4C+28.07
and the Gamma-ray source 3FGLJ0237.9+2848. On January 27th,2018 MJD(2458145.7470),
we found the source with NIR fluxes corresponding to J = 14.169 +/- 0.02,
H = 13.465 +/- 0.03 AND Ks= 12.380 +/- 0.07. While, on MJD 2458067.65 the
flux in the H band corresponded to H = 14.983 +/- 0.03. Hence, the source
has increased its flux by a factor of 4, in this rather short lapse. The
source has shown flaring activity in the past (see ATel #10034) Our observations
are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory

We report the detection of the X-ray transient source AX J1620.1-5002,
with the IBIS/ISGRI and JEM-X detectors aboard the INTEGRAL observatory,
during the Galactic Plane Scan program (PI: Dr A. Bazzano). The source
was observed during revolutions 1913 and 1914; observations were performed
between 2018-01-29 15:06:58 and 2018-01-30 10:24:00 UTC (exposure time
326 ks).  

In a combined analysis of the two revolutions, we detect the source at
RA = 245.03, Dec = -50.01, 3' error radius, and with an overall detection
significance in the 22-60 keV band of 9 sigma. The flux was measured in
the 22-60 keV as 1.2 +/- 0.2^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (11.31 +/- 1.3  mCrab),
with an effective exposure time of 23 ks. 

In revolution 1913 we measure the flux in the 22-60 keV energy band as
1.3 +/- 0.3^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (12.31 +/- 2.9  mCrab), with an effective
exposure time of 4 ks. 

In revolution 1914 we measure the flux in the 22-60 keV energy band as
1.0 +/- 0.2^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (9.23 +/- 1.3 mCrab), with an effective
exposure time of 18 ks. 

AX J1620.1-5002 was only in the JEM-X FOV during revolution 1914 and well
detected at RA= 245.07, Dec=-50.02, 90% 2' error radius. Flux values are
as following: 3-10 keV: 7 +/- 1 mCrab (1.1 +/- 0.2 ^-10 erg cm^-2 s^-1)
at 7 sigma for 10 ks exposure and10-25 keV: 13 +/- 5 mCrab (1.3 +/- 0.5^-10
erg cm^-2 s^-1) at 3 sigma for 9.6 ks exposure. 

We believe this to be the first confirmed detection of AX J1620.1-5002
at hard X-ray energies. We note that in October 2017, MAXI observed a new
source, MAXI J1621-501 (ATel #10869). Its measured position is offset by
~12' from AX J1620.1-5002 and the MAXI error circle is ~13'; i.e., consistent
with the position of both AX J1620.1-5002 and our detection. 

The nature of AX J1620.1-5002 is still not known but is a suggested candidate
magnetically accreting white dwarf (Degenaar et al. 2012 A&A, 540, 22),
but an HMXB nature cannot be completely ruled out (Gemma et al. 2014, ApJSS,
212, 13).

We report observations of the CO (2-1) rotational line at 230 GHz in comet

C/2016 R2 (PANSTARRS) with the Arizona Radio Observatory's Submillimeter

Telescope between Jan 9.99-16.23 UT.  This object is known to be in outburst

since December 2017 (CBET #4464). Mapping of the CO distribution shows
that the 
line emission is detected up to 1' from the nucleus with the signal peaking

close to the nucleus position.  The beam size of SMT is 32"" at this frequency.

The line intensity ranges from 0.34-0.50 K km/s during the observing period,

with a line width between 1.0-1.3 km/s and a velocity shift around 1 km/s.
A 
preliminary analysis of the data shows that the CO production rates span
from 
1.02e29 to 1.44e29 molec/s , assuming a gas kinetic temperature of 30 K.
Other 
molecular lines (CH3OH, HCN, CS, H2CO, HCO+) were not detected in the SMT

observations indicating the coma is strongly depleted in these species

compared with CO.  As the comet reaches higher temperatures during its

perihelion passage on May 9 at a heliocentric distance of 2.6 au, it is

expected that other species will be detectable and further multi-frequency

monitoring of this object is desirable. 

In the table below we list the observing dates, line areas in the main-beam

brightness temperature scale and derived CO production rates with statistical

errors.

In our monitoring campaign of AGNs we found the Blazar 3C279 flaring in
the NIR on January 27th,2018. this source is cross identified with the
quasar HB891253-055 and the Gamma-ray source 3FGLJ1256.1-054. On MJD 2458145.9895,
we found the source with NIR fluxes corresponding to J = 12.584 +/- 0.03,
H = 11.747 +/- 0.04 and Ks = 10.930 +/- 0.05. While, on MJD 2458124.061
the fluxes in the NIR bands corresponded to J = 13.556 +/- 0.07, H = 12.651
+/- 0.05 and K = 11.870 +/- 0.07. Hence, the source has increased its flux
by a factor of 2.5 in the K band in this this rather short lapse. The source
is brightest since the time we started monitoring it on MJD 2454508. Our
observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro
Observatory operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics
and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera.
We encourage further multi wavelength coverage.

The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed strong gamma-ray flaring activity from a
source positionally consistent with the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS
0346-27, also known as 3FGL J0348.6-2748 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218,
23), with coordinates R.A. = 57.1589354 deg, Decl. = -27.8204344 deg (J2000;
Beasley et al. 2002 ApJS, 141, 13), and a redshift of 0.991 (White et al.
1988 ApJ, 327, 561). 

Preliminary analysis indicates that this source went into a high-flux state
starting on 2 February 2018, reaching a peak daily averaged gamma-ray flux
(E>100MeV) of (1.0+/-0.2) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty
only) . The latter corresponds to a flux increase of a factor of about
115 relative to the average flux reported in the third Fermi-LAT catalog
(3FGL). This is the highest LAT daily flux ever observed for this source.
The corresponding photon spectral index of 2.0+/-0.1 is significantly harder
than the 3FGL value of 2.4+/-0.1. Therefore PKS 0346-27 is another example
of the ""harder-when-brighter"" behavior observed in flaring FSRQs. 

Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring
of this source will continue. This source is being added to the ""LAT Monitored
Sources"" and consequently a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray
flux observed by Fermi-LAT will be publicly available (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/).
We encourage further multifrequency observations of this source. For this
source the Fermi-LAT contact person is R. Angioni (angioni@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

The X-ray source 1RXS J051439.2-021615 (RA 05h14m39.20s, Dec -02d16m15.00,
J2000.0) showed an optical V-band flare, during the night of 25/26 January
2018 (JD=2458114). While the source had a relatively stable luminosity
of V=12.84(1) mag during the past days, there was a sudden increase of
the observed flux, which started at HJD=2458144.43313 and reached the peak
of V=11.85(1) mag at HJD= 2458144.43741 within a few minutes. TYC 4755-59-1
was used as a comparison for the photometric reduction and it was found
to be a good standard with V=12.11(1) mag. The observations were obtained
in a 3-min cadence and the brightness was increased by 1 mag within 9 minutes
with a slope of ~0.11 mag/minute. An exponential decline was observed until
the end of the night, when the magnitude dropped from V=11.85(1) mag to
V=12.72(1) mag in approximately 45 minutes. Multi-wavelength observations
on this X-ray source are highly encouraged, while the robotic and remotely
controlled telescope at the University of Athens Observatory (UOAO) will

ATEL #11249,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed enhanced gamma-ray emission from a source
positionally consistent with the flat-spectrum radio quasar  OT 355, also
known as B2 1732+38A and 3FGL J1734.3+3858 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218,
23), with coordinates R.A. =  263.585744 deg, Decl. =  38.964290 deg (J2000;
Lanyi et al. 2010 AJ, 139, 1695), and a redshift of 0.975 (Shaw et al.
2012 ApJ, 748, 49). 

Preliminary analysis indicates that this source went into a high-flux state
starting on 22 January 2018, and brightened over the following days, reaching
a peak daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (1.2+/-0.3) X 10^-6
photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only) on 31 January. The latter
corresponds to a flux increase of a factor of about 25 relative to the
average flux reported in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL). This is the
highest LAT daily flux ever observed for this source. OT 355 is also detected
in the 6-hour interval between 12:00 UTC and 18:00 UTC of the same day,
with an integrated gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (2.0+/-0.8) X 10^-6 photons
cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only), corresponding to about 40 times
the 3FGL flux level. 

Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring
of this source will continue. This source is being added to the ""LAT Monitored
Sources"" and consequently a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray
flux observed by Fermi-LAT will be publicly available (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/).
We encourage further multifrequency observations of this source. For this
source the Fermi-LAT contact person is R. Angioni (angioni@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

MAXI/GSC nova-alert system (Negoro et al. 2016) detected X-ray brightening
from the Be/X-ray binary pulsar GRO J1008-57 on 2018 January 27 (MJD 58145).
According to the MAXI/GSC monitor data, the current brightening has started
from January 23 (MJD 58141).  The onset of this event corresponds to the
orbital phase of 0.90, which is derived from the the orbital parameters,
T<sub>0</sub>=54416.65 (MJD) and P<sub>orb</sub>=249.48 d (K&uuml;hnel
et al. 2013).  The 4-10 keV energy flux increased from 0.019 +- 0.06 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup>
(17 +- 5 mCrab) on January 23 (MJD 58141) to 0.045 +- 0.008 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup>
(39 +- 7 mCrab, ) on January 29 (MJD 58147).  The average flux increase
rate in recent days is ~0.004 photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup>/day.  Above results
indicate that the present brightening is normal (type-I) outburst.

In 2009-2015 season, the MAXI/GSC observations revealed that the onset
phase of the normal outbursts distributed in a narrow range (0.92-0.93)
in orbital phase.  However, the last 4 normal outbursts (Atel#8547,#9512,#10418,#10466)
started from the orbital phase of 0.91 (The light curves of the recent
4 outbursts are shown after shifted at the orbital phase 0 in http://134.160.243.88/news/en/MAXI_News_1_files/groj1008_20180130_gscmed.gif).
We have confirmed that same trend exists in the Swift/BAT monitor data.
This outburst onset shift might imply that the geometrical parameters
of the circumstellar disc around the Be star have changed.  To investigate
the profiles of the Be disc, we encourage multiwavelength observations.

The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE), has detected an intense gamma-ray
flare from  a source positionally coincident with the flat spectrum radio
quasar 3C 279 with redshift of z=0.5362 (Marziani et al. 1996, ApJS, 104,
37) and coordinates of R.A.: 12h56m11.1665s, Dec: -05d47m21.523s ((J2000.0,
Johnston et al. 1995, AJ, 110, 880).  

DAMPE has recorded increased number of photons since January 16th, 2018
UT. The preliminary analysis gives a peak daily flux of ~(6.45 +/- 3.63)
x 10^-7 photons cm^-2 s^-1 above 2 GeV, recorded on January 17th, 2018
UT. The daily light curve shows significant variabilities. The search for
past data of DAMPE reveals relatively low state emission in the past two
years when the source was in the field-of-view. 

DAMPE is operating in the survey mode, and the monitoring of 3C 279 will
continue. 

Detection of flaring activities of 3C 279 was also reported in the gamma-ray
band with H.E.S.S. (ATel #11239), Fermi-LAT (ATel #11189) and AGILE (ATel
#11200), as well as in the optical band (ATels #11190, #11196, #11202,

DAMPE is a space-borne calorimeter detector of high energy cosmic rays
and gamma-rays. The energy range coverage is from 1 GeV to 10 TeV for gamma-rays.

E. Troja (UMD/GSFC) and L. Piro (INAF/IAPS) report on behalf of a larger
collaboration:<br /> 
<br /> 

We analyzed the full set of five observations of GW170817 performed by
the Chandra X-ray Observatory between January 17th 
and January 28th, 2018, i.e. ~153 and ~164 days after the merger. A log
of observations is reported below:<br /> 
<br /> 
ObsID   Exposure [ks]     0.5-8.0 keV count rate [cts/s]<br /> 
<br /> 
20936&emsp;     31.75  &emsp;         0.0018 +/- 0.0002<br /> 
20937&emsp;     20.77  &emsp;          0.0014 +/- 0.0003<br />

20945&emsp;     14.22  &emsp;         0.0010 +/- 0.0003<br /> 
<br /> 
The average net count-rate is 0.00148 +/- 0.00011 cts/s, consistent with
the value 0.00145 +/- 0.00014 observed at 110 days. 
The average spectrum, obtained by coadding the five exposures, is well
described by an absorbed power-law model with N_H=7.5E20 cm^-2 and photon
index Gamma=1.65+/-0.16 (68% c.l.), consistent with the value derived from
the broadband spectrum at earlier times (Troja et al. 2018, arXiv:1801.06516).
Based on this new analysis, we estimate an unabsorbed X-ray flux of (2.6
+/- 0.3)E-14 erg/cm2/s (68% c.l.) in the 0.3-10 keV band, consistent with
the X-ray flux measured at 110 days. 
<br /> 

Our results do not support the claim of a decreasing X-ray flux, as suggested
by D'Avanzo et al. (2018, arXiv:1801.06164), and are consistent either
with a slowly rising afterglow or a slow turn-over of the X-ray light curve
expected when the afterglow reaches its peak (e.g. Lazzati et al.2017,
arXiv:1712.03237; Troja et al. 2018, arXiv:1801.06516). 
<br /> 

We note that the X-ray afterglow displays a marginal level of variability
on timescales of a few days, being the count-rate from the last two exposures
(20939,20945) consistently lower. The spectrum from these two observations
is characterized by a photon index Gamma= 1.9 +/- 0.3 (68% c. l.), slightly
softer than the value measured in the first three exposures (20936, 20937,
and 20938) Gamma = 1.59+/-0.17  (68% c. l.), yet consistent within the
large uncertainties. The lower count-rate and soft spectral shape could
be indicative of the cooling frequency entering the X-ray band, although
the limited statistics prevent us to draw any firm conclusion.

The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed enhanced gamma-ray emission from a source
positionally consistent with the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 0336-01
(CTA 26), also known as 3FGL J0339.5-0146 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218,
23), with coordinates R.A. = 54.8789071 deg, Decl. = -1.7766119 deg (J2000;
Johnston et al. 1995 AJ, 110, 880), and a redshift of 0.850 (Wills & Lynds
1978 ApJS, 36, 317). 

Preliminary analysis indicates that this source went into a high-flux state
starting on 21 January 2018, and continued to brighten over the following
days, reaching a peak daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (2.2+/-0.2)
X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty only) on 23 January.
The latter corresponds to a flux increase of a factor of about 28 relative
to the average flux reported in the third Fermi-LAT catalog (3FGL). This
is the highest LAT daily flux ever reported for the source, corresponding
to about double the flux observed during a previously reported flaring
episode in October 2014 (ATel #6568). The corresponding photon spectral
index of 1.96+/-0.08 is significantly harder than the 3FGL value of 2.25+/-0.05.
Therefore PKS 0336-01 is another example of the ""harder-when-brighter""
behavior observed in several flaring FSRQs. 

Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring
of this source will continue. This source is included in the ""LAT Monitored
Sources"" and consequently a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray
flux observed by Fermi-LAT will be publicly available (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/).
We encourage further multifrequency observations of this source. For this
source the Fermi-LAT contact persons are Roopesh Ojha (roopesh.ojha@gmail.com)

ATEL #11228,"
Following detection of pulsations with 31.6 s period in Supergiant HMXB,
associated with impostor-SN2010da (ATel#11158) we used recent Swift-XRT
observation (ObsId:00049834015) performed on 24 Jan 2018 (initiated after
ATel#11174, see also ATel#11179 for correct period determination) in order
to monitor long-term period evolution.  

Source is clearly seen, with 0.3-10 keV unabsorbed flux of 4x10<sup>-12</sup>
erg cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, which correspond to luminosity of 2x10<sup>38</sup>
erg s<sup>-1</sup>. Using barycentered events we found a significant signal,
corresponding to 20.06 s period, matching with one predicted in ATel#11179.

Therefore NGC300 ULX-1 continues to spin-up with mean rate of -3.3x10<sup>-7</sup>
s s<sup>-1</sup> over ~400 days from first period detection. 
Using period measured by Swift-XRT on 22 Apr 2017 we calculated spin-up
rate of -2.7x10<sup>-7</sup> s s<sup>-1</sup> over 278 days, which is two
times lower than measured during brighter phase with L<sub>X</sub> ~ 3x10<sup>39</sup>
erg s<sup>-1</sup> (ATel#11158). 

We are very grateful to the Swift team for a rapid scheduling of our observations.

ATEL #11229,"
We report on analysis of archival Swift/XRT observations on the supernova
impostor SN 2010da AKA NGC 300 ULX-1, which has seen a recent flurry of
reports of its rapid spin evolution (e.g. ATEL #11158, ATEL #11174, ATEL
#11179, ATEL #11228). A total of 9 Swift/XRT observations of this source
have been taken which have sufficient exposure and in which the source
was sufficiently bright enough to detect pulsations. These observations
were taken between April 25th, 2016 and January 25th, 2018. 

A 2909s exposure Photon Counting (PC) mode observation taken on April 25th,
2016 is the earliest observation of this source in which we are able to
detect a coherent periodicity, and is reported on for the first time here.

In order to perform a period search of these data, we corrected the photon
arrival times to the solar system barycenter, and randomized the photon
arrival times within the ~2.5s PC mode frame time to avoid aliasing issues.
Performing a standard Z<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> search of the data, we
find a pulsar period of P = 44.18072 +/- 0.00079 s for this epoch. The
quoted error is 1-sigma and estimated using the Monte-Carlo method described
by Gotthelf et al. (1999, ApJ, 522, L49). 

With measurements of the pulsar spin period spanning ~640 days, including
the XMM-Newton measured value reported by Carpano et al. (ATEL #11158),
we find that the spin-up cannot be described by a simple linear model.
Therefore, we fit a standard pulsar spin-up model incorporating both first
and second derivatives of the spin period. Fitting this model, we find
that the global spin-up evolution of NGC 300 ULX-1 can be described by
P<sub>dot</sub> = -7.54 +/- 0.07 x 10<sup>-7</sup> s s<sup>-1</sup> and
P<sub>dot-dot</sub> = -1.04 +/- 0.03 x 10<sup>-9</sup> s s<sup>-2</sup>.

We note that the fit has significant scatter in the residuals, likely due
to the unfit contribution of the orbital motion and other effects, however
the model well describes the bulk spin-up of the pulsar over a large range
of spin periods (20 s to 44.2 s) over a 21 month period. 

We also note that after removing aliasing effects of PC mode by randomizing
the photon arrival times, we do not detect the 30.05s period reported by
Grebenev et al. (ATEL #11174) in data taken by Swift/XRT on April 16, 2017,
confirming that this was an erroneous detection caused by aliasing of the
PC mode frame time, as suggested by Vasilopoulos et al. (ATEL #11179).
However, we do detect a periodicity in those data at P = 26.711 +/- 0.002
s, consistent with other reported periods derived from observations taken
around that time. 

Continued observations to constrain both the spin-up and orbital parameters
of this system are encouraged.

We report an increase in the X-ray flux from the magnetar 1E 1048.1-5937
in our recent monitoring observation with the X-ray Telescope (XRT) on
the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. We measure an absorbed  0.5-10 keV
flux of (22+/-2)x10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 on 15 January 2018 (MJD 58133), and
confirmed the persistent nature of this increase measuring a flux of (20+/-1)x10^-12
erg/s/cm^2  on subsequent observations on 26-27 January 2018 (MJD 58144-58145)
compared to an average flux of (9.2+/-0.5)x10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 in December
2017. As the source is currently in a state of high and varying torque
(see Archibald et al. 2015), we cannot at this time place a limit on any
change in  the timing properties. The 0.5-10 keV pulse profile shows no
significant deviation from the quiescent profile, and we detect no significant
bursts at a 100-ms timescale in any of these observations. This new outburst
epoch has occurred before a full radiative recovery from the last outburst
which started in July 2016 (ATEL #9316). Observations at other wavelengths

ObsID,  ExpTime,  StartDate,           Days Post-Burst

-----   -------   ---------            ---------------

20936   31.75 ks  2018-01-17 21:55:17  153.5 days

20938   15.86 ks  2018-01-21 13:45:18  157.1 days

20939   22.25 ks  2018-01-24 08:18:48  159.9 days

Since these new Chandra exposures are close in time and the X-ray emission
of GRB170817A is not expected to vary significantly over <10 day timescales,
we co-add these three data sets into one 69.86 ks exposure at 156.4 days
post-burst.

We perform spectral extractions assuming an absorbed power-law spectral
model with fixed NH = 7.5e20 cm^-2 and find that the X-ray flux of GRB170817A
has an absorbed flux of f(0.3-8 keV) = 1.93(+0.39/-0.32)e-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2
(with Gamma ~ 1.67) at 156.4 days post-burst, which corresponds to an
unabsorbed luminosity of L(0.3-10 keV) = 5.23(+1.30/-0.95)e39 erg s^-1
(assuming a luminosity distance of 42.5 Mpc).

This represents continued X-ray brightening compared to Chandra observations
at 15.6 and 109.2 days post-burst, for which we find an absorbed flux of
f(0.3-8 keV) = 0.36(+0.1/-0.07)e-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 (with Gamma = 2.4 +/-
0.8, unabsorbed L(0.3-10 keV) = 10.4(+2.0/-1.6)e38 erg s^-1; Haggard et
al. 2017) and f(0.3-8 keV) = 1.58(+0.14/-0.13)e-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 (with
Gamma = 1.6 +/- 0.3, unabsorbed L(0.3-10 keV) = 42.5(+3.7/-3.5)e38 erg
s^-1; Ruan et al. 2018), respectively.

Our findings here contradict recent reports of dimming in the X-ray flux
from XMM Newton at 135 days (D'Avanzo et al. 2018), which was reported
to be 2.1(+0.7/-0.5)e-15 erg s^-1 cm^-2 (0.3-10 keV unabsorbed). However,
this reported flux value is a typo, and should be 2.1(+0.7/-0.5)e-14 erg
s^-1 cm^-2 (D'Avanzo 2018, private communication). Taking this corrected
flux and rescaling to a 0.3-8 keV absorbed flux for comparison to the previous
Chandra measurements above gives 1.67(+0.87/-0.64)e-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2.
Thus, the recent X-ray data at 15.6 days (Chandra), 109.2 days (Chandra),
135 days (XMM), and 156.4 days (Chandra) are all consistent with continued
X-ray brightening. We provide a light curve table summarizing these measurements:

Current post-merger models suggest that the origin of the X-rays could
be afterglow emission from either a mildly-relativistic cocoon or a structured
jet. For a cocoon, the continued rise of X-ray emission suggest that the
cocoon has not yet reached a deceleration phase. For a structured jet,
the rising X-ray emission suggest emission from the jet core has not yet
entered the observed line of sight. Continued monitoring of GW170817 will
be critical for discriminating between these and other models.

NB: Another ~30 ks of Chandra observations are forthcoming.

We thank Belinda Wilkes and the Chandra scheduling, data processing, and
archive teams for making these observations possible.

ATEL #11243,"
The Chandra X-ray Observatory re-observed the field of GW170817 starting
on January 17th, 2018, and performed five short exposures observations
as part of its on-going monitoring program (PI: Wilkes). Only three of
these exposures (ObsID: 20936, 20938, 20939) are currently archived and
available to the public. Here we report the preliminary findings from these
observations.  

The X-ray afterglow is detected with high significance in all the exposures
at an average count rate of 0.0016 cts/s in the 0.5-8.0 keV energy band.
A preliminary inspection of the hardness ratio does not show any significant
spectral variation. Therefore, we perform a spectral analysis using an
absorbed power-law model with absorption column fixed at the Galactic value
of 7.5E20 cm^-2 and a photon index Gamma=1.575 as derived from our broadband
analysis (Troja et al. 2018, arXiv:1801.06516).  

We derive an unabsorbed X-ray flux of (3.2 +/- 0.3)E-14 erg/cm2/s in the
0.3-10 keV energy band. The quoted error is at the 68% confidence level.
This new measurement is higher than the value measured by Chandra at ~110
days (~2.5E-14 erg/cm2/s, Troja et al. 2018), and higher than the value
measured by XMM-Newton at ~135 days (D'Avanzo et al., 2018).  

The latest measurement is consistent with a rising afterglow with F~t^0.8,
although, within the errors, a slow turn-over of the X-ray light curve
cannot be excluded. 

Further analysis is on-going.

ATEL #11239,"
H.E.S.S. observations of the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 (redshift
z=0.536, R.A.: 12h56m11.1665s, Dec: -05d47m21.523s (J2000)) have been carried
out during the past 2 weeks, on the basis of the detection of flaring activity
in the gamma-ray band with Fermi-LAT (ATel #11189) and AGILE (ATel #11200),
as well as in the optical band (ATels #11190, #11196, #11202, #11216).

A preliminary online analysis of the data acquired with CT5 (monoscopic
analysis) of previous nights indicates no detection, while during the night
January 27-28 the online analysis shows an unprecedented flux with a total
significance of ~11 standard deviations in 1.8 hours of observation. This
could be the highest flux level of this source ever seen at very high energies
(E>100 GeV). Unfortunately, further observations cannot be planned beside
the upcoming night due to Moon constraints, however a multi-wavelength
coverage is strongly encouraged. 

H.E.S.S. is an array of five imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes for
the detection of VHE gamma-ray sources. H.E.S.S. is located in the Khomas
Highland in Namibia. It was constructed and is operated by researchers
from Armenia, Australia, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany,
Ireland, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, UK, and the host country, Namibia.

ATEL #11238,"
We obtained an optical spectrum (range 350-900 nm) of SN 2018kv, discovered
by the Tsinghua-NAOC Transient Survey, on UT 2018 Jan. 26.9 with the Li-Jiang
2.4 m telescope (LJT+YFOSC) at Li-Jiang Observatory of Yunnan Observatories.
The spectrum is consistent with that of a type Ia supernova at a few days
after the maximum light. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova
spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry
2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 2006S at t = +4 days
from the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift of 0.077 (via SNID
fitting) an expansion velocity of about 10500 km/s can be derived from
the absorption minimum of Si II 635.5 nm.

ATEL #11233,"
According to ATel#11223, the gamma-ray binary MWC 148 (HESS J0632+057)
is in high X-ray and TeV state. 
We performed optical spectroscopy of this object on the night of 2018 Jan
25 and compare the results 
with our previous spectral observations. All observations are obtained
with the ESpeRo spectrograph (Bonev et al. 2017, BlgAJ, 26, 67) at the
2m RCC telescope at Rozhen NAO, Bulgaria. 

Here are the dates of the observations and the equivalent width of the
H-alpha emission line in angstroms:

2015 Dec 27    EW=-42.21

2016 Jan 30    EW=-41.87

2017 Dec 30    EW=-44.10

2018 Jan 25    EW=-44.50

On the base on our latest observations, we can confirm that the radius
of the circumstellar disc around the B0pe donor star is greater compared
to the data presented in Zamanov et al. (2016, A&A, 593, 97). On the Fig.
1 is a comparison of the H-alpha and H-beta emission lines, obtained on
2014 Jan 13 and 2018 Jan 25(four years apart). It is visible that the H-alpha
emission is increased, while there are no significant changes in the H-beta
line. This is a clear evidence for structural changes in the outer parts
of the circumstellar disc, where the H-alpha emission is formed.

ATEL #11235,"
The gamma-ray loud flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1424-418 has been 
steadily increasing its luminosity since August 2017 and is now 
(2018-01-21) at its historic recorded maximum of J=13.73 +/- 0.05. These

observations were performed with the REM telescope in La Silla within 
the framework the TANAMI collaboration 
(http://pulsar.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/tanami/) monitoring of a 
sample of gamma-ray loud southern hemisphere blazars. 
Photometry was made with IRAF/apphot using 10 comparison stars from the
2MASS catalog. 

Our NIR light curve is very well correlated with the gamma-ray light 
curve publicly available from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) 
instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (see 
https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/). A gamma-ray 
flare was also recently reported by AGILE (ATel#11222). 

Our NIR/optical monitoring will continue at least for the current year

and possible further activity will be reported using this and other 
platforms.  

We note that this source, during a previous multiwavelength outburst, has
provided a high-energy fluence high enough to explain the IC35 `Big Bird'
neutrino (Aartsen et al. 2014, Phys. Rev. Letters 113, 101,101; Kadler
et al. 2016, Nature Phys. 12, 807). We encourage multi-messenger observations
and analyses of PKS 1424-418 during this active state.

ATEL #11236,"
We report the X-ray detection of the massive protostar IRAS 16562-3959
as well as one of its outer radio lobes (Guzman et al. 2010, ApJ,725,734)
using two observations obtained by the Chandra X-ray Observatory ACIS-I
detector on 2015-06-30 (38.58ks exposure) and 2015-07-03 (40.07 ks exposure).
The X-ray source position of the star are 16:59:41.64, -40:03:43.7. IRAS
16562-3959 is a bright infrared source with a reported bolometric luminosity
of 7*10^4 L_sun. Summing the two observations, Chandra observed a net 76+/-9
counts from the protostar and 99+/-11 counts from the outer eastern lobe,
or count rates of 9.6+/-1.1e-4 c/s and 13+/-1.3e-4 c/s respectively. Over
the observation, we observed variability of about a factor of two in the
protostar. The protostar X-ray spectrum is well-represented by an absorbed
thermal plasma emission model (xsapec with xsphabs).  The best-fit model
parameters are a temperature of kT = 0.57(+0.45/-0.23) keV and hydrogen
column density of nH = 8.0(+5.7/-3.3) cm^-2. The flux of the protostar
in the 0.5-7 keV band is 2.3(+1.7/-3.0)e-14 erg/cm^2/s. The flux of the
outer radio lobe in the 0.5-7 keV band is 2.3(+1.7/-2.9)e-14 erg/cm^2/s
(all uncertainties 1 sigma).

The Chandra X-ray Observatory's ACIS-S CCD has detected the Cataclysmic
Variable  G343.3-0.6 at the coordinates 17:01:28.164, -43:06:12.513. Since
its source Nova Sco 1437 was first recorded (Shara et al., 2017 Nature,
548,558), G343.3-0.6 has developed into a ""deep eclipsing CV"" with an orbital
period of 4.4 hours (F. Berdinardi et al., 2017, MNRAS 470,4815). Chandra
observed G343.3-0.6 for 9.13ks on 2015-06-30, and measured 3295 +/- 58
counts from the point source or 0.360 +/- 0.006 counts/s. We extracted
the spectrum of the source in the 0.5-10 keV band and found it well-represented
by a combination of a thermal (blackbody) and non-thermal (power law) components,
absorbed by the interstellar medium. The best-fit gave a power law index
of 0.63 +/- 0.08, an absorbing column nH of (6.5 +/- 0.09)e21 cm^-2 and
a kT of 0.059 +/- 0.010 keV.  From this model fit, we found a flux of (1.02+/-0.3)e-11
erg/cm^2/s in the 0.5-10 keV band.  The X-ray signal was modulated with
a period of approximately 1900s which we interpret as the white dwarf spin
period, consistent with the findings of F. Berdinardi et al.

We observed Nova Mus 2018 (PNV J11261220-6531086) with the Neil Gehrels
Swift Observatory on 2018 January 21, 18 days after the initial rapid rise
to V=8.8 on 2018 January 3.24 (see link below for more details).  Due to
the optical brightness of the nova, the XRT instrument was operated in
Windowed Timing mode.  The net exposure time was 1465s, during which the
nova was not detected.  The 3-sigma upper limit on the 0.3-10 keV count
rate is 0.025 cts/s.

A UV image of the nova was also obtained with the UVOT instrument in the
UVM2 filter (central wavelength 224.6nm). Nova Mus 2018 is saturated in
the 659s exposure, indicating m_uvm2 < 10.42 mags.

Additional Swift monitoring of this nova will take place with weekly cadence
over the next two months.

The High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS; Crause et al. 2014, Proc SPIE, 91476)
mounted on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) was used to obtain
observations of nova Muscae 2018 (PNV J11261220-6531086) on 2018 January
21 .36 (UTC; HJD 2458139.86). The observations were taken in the MR mode
of HRS, covering a spectral range of 3800-8900 &#8491; at a resolution
of R ~ 40000. The nova was discovered on 2018 January 14 .5 (CBET #4472)
at V = 7.0. On the same day a low resolution spectrum was obtained confirming
the nova classification and showing features of the Fe II spectroscopic
class. The SALT data reported here were reduced with the SALT HRS MIDAS
pipeline (Kniazev et al. 2016, MNRAS 459, 3068). 

The SALT HRS spectrum is consistent with the Fe II classification, showing
strong permitted lines of H I, Fe II, O I, Ca II, Na I, Mg II, and forbidden
lines of O I (see below a full list of the line identification). The lines
have rounded profiles accompanied with P Cygni absorption features, characteristic
of an optically thick ejecta and typical for Fe II class novae. The Balmer
(H&#946; and H&#945;) lines consist of: (1) a main emission, moderately
broad, component with a FWHM = 1700 &plusmn; 100 km/s; (2) two absorption
components at -750 &plusmn; 50 km/s and -1700 &plusmn; 50 km/s where the
higher velocity absorption component is broader; (3) a second blue-emission-component
with a FWHM = 320 &plusmn; 30 km/s at around -1100 &plusmn; 50 km/s; (4)
a red emission wing extending to more than 2600 km/s. The features and
their velocities are consistent with the measurements reported in ATel
#11183. These features are also easily identifiable in the Fe II (42) multiplet
(the strongest Fe II emissions) and in the O I 7773 line.

AGILE is detecting a gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV from a source consistent
with the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar PKS B1424-418 (also known as 3FGL J1427.9-4206
and BZQ J1427-4206) at z=1.52. 

For a two-day integration, from 2018-01-22 09:50 UT to 2018-01-24 09:50
UT, a maximum likelihood analysis yields a detection at a significance
level above 5 sigma, and a flux F = (2.9 +/- 0.9) x 10-6 ph/cm^2/s (E >
100 MeV).  

The AGILE-GRID detection was obtained while AGILE is observing in spinning
mode, surveying a large fraction of the sky each day. The source can be
monitored with the public mobile application ""AGILEScience"" developed by
the AGILE Team, available for both Android and iOS devices. 

Multifrequency observations of PKS B1424-418 are strongly encouraged.

Observations by the VERITAS collaboration and with the Swift XRT show
the  
TeV and X-ray emission of the gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057  
(RA 06h32m59.26s,   Dec +05d48m01.2s, J2000.0) are comparable to the  
highest ever observed from this object. HESS J0632+057 (VER J0633+057 in
the 
VERITAS catalog) is associated with the B0pe star MWC 148 and the 
X-ray source XMMU J063259.3+054801, and has also been weakly 
detected at GeV energies. The binary orbital period is 315 days, and 
the nature of the compact object is unknown. Correlated X-ray and 
TeV flares have been observed in the past, usually peaking around 
orbital phase 0.35. The system is currently at phase 
0.42. Observations made with VERITAS on MJDs 58136 and 58141 detect 
the source with a statistical significance in excess of 10 standard deviations
in an 
exposure of 4.3 hours. The integral gamma-ray flux is 5.9e-12 &plusmn
7.7e-13 
photons cm^-2 s^-1 above 350 GeV (corresponding to about 6% of the flux
of the Crab 
Nebula above the same energy), about twice the flux typically measured
in this 
orbital phase range.  
Swift XRT observations on MJD 58142  
show a 0.3-10 keV count rate of 0.060 &plusmn 0.007. 

We encourage multi-wavelength observations. VERITAS observations 
will continue until Sep 26th, but will not be possible over the following
full Moon 
period. Questions regarding VERITAS should be directed to Reshmi 
Mukherjee (rmukherj@nevis.columbia.edu). The VERITAS array is located 
at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona, USA 
(<a href=""http://veritas.sao.arizona.edu"">http://veritas.sao.arizona.edu</a>).

The Type Ic SN 2018ec (ATel #11156, #11160) in the nearby Luminous Infrared
Galaxy NGC 3256 has been observed with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA) at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz on 2018 Jan 23.8 UT. No radio emission
was detected at the reported location, to a 3-sigma upper limit of 10 milliJy/beam
(5.5 GHz) and 3.6 milliJy/beam (9.0 GHz). These somewhat large upper limits
are due to the limited uv-coverage, plus the close proximity of the SN
(10"") to the core emission from NGC 3256 (0.2 Jy at 5.5 GHz). Adopting
the host galaxy distance of 37.4 Mpc from Tully (1988, Nearby Galaxy Catalog)
this implies an upper limit on the 9 GHz luminosity at an age of at least
one month of 6E27 erg/s/Hz. We would like to extend our thanks to the ATCA
staff for enabling these observations. The Australia Telescope Compact
Array is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a National
Facility managed by CSIRO.

We obtained an optical spectrum (range 350-900 nm) of SN 2018iq (=AT2017jzx),
discovered by Koichi Itagaki, on UT 2018 Jan. 20.7 with the Li-Jiang 2.4
m telescope (LJT+YFOSC) at Li-Jiang Observatory of Yunnan Observatories.
The spectrum is consistent with that of a type Ia supernova at a few days
before the maximum light. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova
spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry
2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 2005cf at t = -8 days
from the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift of 0.0235 of the
Host galaxy NGC 2746 an expansion velocity of about 14500 km/s can be derived
from the absorption minimum of Si II 635.5 nm. Our classification spectrum

an SSS turn-off time of less than 18 days after the likely eruption date

We present spectroscopic confirmation of two new optical transients as
Galactic novae.  

PNV J17180658-3204279 was discovered on UT 2018 Jan. 17.9 by H. Nishimura
(<a href=http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/unconf/followups/J17180658-3204279.html>CBET</a>).
We obtained a spectrum of the source with the Goodman spectrograph on the
SOAR telescope on 2018 Jan 21.36. The spectrum shows broad (FWHM ~ 1700-2200
km/s) Balmer emission and many Fe II emission lines, indicating a classification
as a classical nova of the Fe II class. 

PNV J13532700-6725110 was discovered on UT 2018 Jan. 19.7 by J. Seach (<a
href=http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/unconf/followups/J13532700-6725110.html>CBET</a>).
S. Kiyota reported the presence of Balmer emission lines in a spectrum
taken on Jan 20.6. We obtained a spectrum with SOAR on Jan 21.28. The spectrum
shows clear P Cygni profiles in the Balmer lines, with the absorption troughs
located about 1300 km/s blueward of rest wavelength and emission a FWHM
of about 1500 km/s. A number of Fe II lines are also apparent, some of
which also have P Cygni profiles. These characteristics suggest that this
transient is also an Fe II nova.

We obtained an optical spectrum of DLT18a/AT2018is (Atel #11207) on UT
2018 January 21.3 with the Goodman Spectrograph on the SOAR telescope.
The spectrum displays a blue continuum with prominent Halpha, Hbeta and
He lines, with approximate velocities of 4000 km/s (after a host-redshift
correction).  Spectral classification was performed with SNID (Blondin
and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), with good matches to faint type II SNe
about 1-2 weeks after explosion.  The spectrum is also similar to a luminous
blue variable outburst, such as NGC4559_OT. 
Given the current absolute magnitude of this transient, M_V~-13, either
interpretation is plausible.  We encourage further observations.

5.5 and 9.0 GHz on 2018 Jan 18.6 UT. No radio emission was detected at
the reported location, to a 3-sigma upper limit of 120 microJy/beam (5.5
GHz) and 30 microJy/beam (9.0 GHz). Adopting the host galaxy distance from
Tully et al. (2013, AJ, 146, 86) of 16.8 Mpc, this implies an upper limit
on the 9.0 GHz luminosity of 1.0E25 erg/s/Hz. Using the same model as in
ATel #10168 for SN 2016coj, and assuming that we observed SN 2018gv 12
days after explosion, this corresponds to an upper limit on the wind mass
loss rate of the supernova progenitor of 1.9e-8 solar masses per year (3-sigma)
for an assumed wind speed of 100 km/s. We would like to extend our thanks
to the ATCA staff for enabling these observations. The Australia Telescope
Compact Array is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation
as a National Facility managed by CSIRO.

We observed the optically-bright Galactic nova in Musca (CBET #4473, ATel
#11183, #11201) at radio wavelengths with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array (ATCA) on 2018 Jan 18.8 UT. No radio emission was detected at the
nova's location, yielding 3-sigma upper limits of 60 microJy/bm at 5.5
GHz, and 40 microJy/bm at 9 GHz. We are planning future radio monitoring
observations of this nova, and encourage all multi-wavelength observations.

ATEL #11205,"
We obtained an optical spectrum (range 375-830 nm) of SN 2018ie (=kait-18A),discovered
by Lick Supernova Survey, on UT Jan. 19.81 2018 with the 2.16-m telescope
(+BFOSC) at Xinglong Station of National Astronomical Observatories of
China (NAOC). The spectrum is consistent with that of a type Ic supernova
at around the maximum light. Cross-correlation with a library of supernova
spectra using the GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488, 383) tool
shows that it matches with a few broadlined SNe Ic at a few days before
the maximum light. Our classification spectrum is also posted on the IAU

ATEL #11207,"
We report the discovery of DLT18a/AT 2018is. The object was discovered
2018 1 20.64 UT at R~17.9 mag during the ongoing D<40 Mpc (DLT40) one day
cadence supernova search, using data from the PROMPT 5 0.41m telescope
located at CTIO. A confirmation image was obtained on 2018 1 20.65 using
a COJ 0.4m telescope at Sliding Spring Observatory in NSW Australia as
a part of the Las Cumbres Observatory network. DLT18a/AT 2018is is located
at RA: 13:16:57.35 Dec: -16:37:04.43, (-21.42, +56.17 arcsec offset from
the center of the host galaxy NGC5054). We do not detect the transient
on 2017 7.1 UT or in prior imaging of the field. All images were taken
in a 'Clear' filter which was calibrated to an approximate r-band magnitude
using the USNO-B1 catalog. Further observations are encouraged

"
ATEL #11208,"
GX 339-4 is a black hole X-ray transient that entered outburst in September
2017 (ATel #10797). During early outburst, observations were carried out
by Swift (ATel #10798), ATCA (ATel #10808), SALT (ATel #10820, #10864),
NICER (ATel #10824), and NuSTAR (ATel #10825), among others. These observations
found the source to be visible in X-rays, optical and radio bands, and
also detected both sub-second and large-scale flaring activity.

On 1st November 2017, GX 339-4 became Sun constrained with Swift, and could
not be observed until 20th January 2018. We have now observed the source
again with Swift/XRT.

The observation (ObsID: 00032898161) was carried out on 2018-01-20T17:26:57
for a duration of 76s in Window Timing (WT) mode and 925s in Photon Counting
(PC) mode. Swift XRT (XRT; Burrows et al. 2005 SSRv 120 165) data products
built using the automated pipeline (Evans et al. 2009 MNRAS 397 1177) show
that GX 339-4 has declined in flux compared to the previous observations
taken late last year. Using a fit with an absorbed power law, the source
is found to have an absorbed flux of 3.5 (+/-0.3)e-10 erg/s/cm2 for the
0.3-10 keV band, with photon index (gamma)=1.36(+/-0.16) and N(H)=5.1(+/-1.3)e21/cm2,
for the PC mode (w-statistic=368/411). The results for the WT mode spectrum
are consistent within the uncertainties, with Gamma=1.47(+/-0.23).

The source is still active, though the flux is lower by a factor of ~2-3
as compared to the peak fluxes seen by Swift/XRT in Oct/Nov 2017. The current
photon index implies that the source is in the hard state, and the lower
flux suggests that it may be in decline. <a href=""https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/weak/GX339-4/"">Swift
BAT</a> and <a href=""http://maxi.riken.jp/star_data/J1702-487/J1702-487.html"">MAXI</a>
light curves are consistent with a declining trend.

This therefore may have been a failed outburst, not uncommon for this source,
unless the soft state was very brief and missed during Sun constraint.
There currently exists a valuable opportunity to study the decline as the
source visibility improves over the coming weeks and months for ground
and space telescopes. To this end, Swift XRT will continue to monitor the
source with a 5 day cadence over the coming month, and multiwavelength
observations are welcome.

We would like to thank the Swift Team for their scheduling of these observations.

ATEL #11200,"
AGILE is detecting an intense gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV from a source
consistent with the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar 3C 279 (RA: 194.046527 deg,
Dec: -5.789312 deg, J2000) at z=0.536. 

Integrating from 2018-01-18 03:50 UT to 2018-01-19 03:50 UT, a maximum
likelihood analysis yields a detection at a significance level above 12
sigma, and a flux F = (1.8 +/- 0.3) x 10^-5 ph/cm^2/s (E > 100 MeV). For
a 12-hour integration, starting from 2018-01-18 00:00 UT, a preliminary
maximum likelihood analysis yields a flux F = (2.2 +/- 0.5) x 10^-5 ph/cm^2/s
(E > 100 MeV).  

This is the highest flux above 100 MeV measured by AGILE since June 2015
(ATel #7631, #7633, Pittori et al. 2018 (submitted to ApJ)), and higher
with respect to the recent detections reported by Fermi-LAT in ATel #11189
and by AGILE in ATel #11115. The source is also reported to be in optical
high-state (ATel #11190, #11196). 

The AGILE-GRID detection was obtained while AGILE is observing in spinning
mode, surveying a large fraction of the sky each day. The source can be
monitored with the public mobile application ""AGILEScience"" developed by
the AGILE Team, available for both Android and iOS devices. 

Multifrequency observations of 3C 279 are strongly encouraged.

ATEL #11201,"
We report a possible gamma-ray detection of the Galactic nova candidate
PNV J11261220-6531086 (CBET #4472). Since 2018-01-11UT, a significant gamma-ray
source has been seen in the direction of the nova candidate with averaged
TS = 65 (8-sigma detection significance) and F(100MeV-300GeV) = 2.4 x 10^-7
ph/cm^2/s (photon index of 2.2 assumed). We also performed a gtfindsrc
analysis to constrain the position of the source, which is well consistent
with the nova position: RA (J2000) 11h 26m 15.16s, DEC (J2000) -65d 31'
23.3"". The daily TS of the last four days are 14 (Jan 15), 33 (Jan 16),
14 (Jan 17), and 12 (Jan 18) with F(100MeV-300GeV) ~> 10^-7 ph/cm^2/s,
indicating that the nova is still active in gamma-rays.  

A Fermi ToO program for the transient is on-going until 2018-01-22 18:03:26
UTC. Swift and SOAR follow-up observations have been scheduled. More multi-wavelength
observations are strongly encouraged.

We report optical spectroscopic confirmation of the recent M31 nova candidate
M31N 2018-01a (AT2018gw) (= PNV J00444425+4142449) (= ATLAS18eat) discovered
by Emmanuel Conseil on 2018 Jan. 10.860 UT. 

The spectral data were obtained on 2018 Jan. 17.746 UT using the Russian
BTA telescope equipped with the SCORPIO spectrograph. The spectrum was
taken with a resolution of 5.3 Å in the 4050 - 5810 Å range. The photometry
of the nova was obtained just before the time of the BTA spectrum with
the same device gave B = 18.48 &plusmn; 0.06, V = 18.14 &plusmn; 0.03,
Rc = 17.81 &plusmn; 0.05. 

The nova M31N 2018-01a shows Balmer emission lines together with all the
Fe II lines. In the main lines: H-delta, H-gamma, H-beta, Fe II (4923,
5018, 5169 &Aring;) we observe P Cyg profiles. The blue edge in the absorption
components reach to 1870 &plusmn; 50 km/s. The hydrogen H-beta line has
a width of FWHM = 1060 &plusmn; 40 km/s, the H-gamma and H-delta have FWHM
= 1150 &plusmn; 50 km/s. Three Fe II lines have FWHM = 980 &plusmn; 100
km/s. The widths were corrected for spectral resolution. In the case of
the hydrogen lines, we find narrow peaks both in absorption and emission
components, however for Fe II lines we observe round-shaped profiles in
absorption and emission components. We conclude that the M31 nova belongs
to the Fe II class.

We observed tonight the z=0.5632  (Marziani et al. 1996, ApJS, 104, 37)
flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 (with FK5 coordinates RA 12 56 11.167
Dec -05 47 21.52 J2000.0) with the 0.3 m telescope at the Astronomical
Observatory of the University of Siena. This observation was performed
within the frame of a guidance project about astrophysics involving high
school students from the Liceo ""Tito Sarrocchi"" (Siena) and Liceo ""Carlo
Cattaneo"" (Follonica). 

Observation of this target was triggered by the recent alerts issued by
the Fermi/LAT collaboration (ATel #11189) and by the REM telescope (ATel
#11190) reporting a flaring state of the source both in gamma rays and
in optical-NIR. Observation consists of  4 x 300 s exposures in the Johnson-Cousins
R filter, taken in 2x2 binning under good observing conditions with clear
sky and seeing 4.8"" (FWHM), starting at JD=2458136.6377 (civil date  2018-01-18
h. 3:18 UT). The source altitude was about 39 degrees during the observation.
After dark current subtraction and flat field correction images were averaged
and preliminary photometric analysis was performed by means of the MaximDL
software package. Reference and check stars in the field of view were taken
from the finding chart made available by Landessternwarte Koenigstuhl at
https://www.lsw.uni-heidelberg.de/projects/extragalactic/charts/1253-055.html
. The reference R magnitudes for these stars are taken from Villata et
al., A&AS 130, 305 (1998).  

We obtained for 3C 279 a magnitude R=13.87 +- 0.02 at JD=2458136.6452 (civil
date 2018-01-18 h. 03:29 UT). Quoted uncertainty is statistical only. Measurement
comes from a preliminary photometric analysis and may be subject to later
refinement.  
This magnitude is compatible with the R-band measurement provided on January
17 by the REM telescope (ATel #11190). We can also compare this measurement
with two previous measurements taken within our blazar monitoring program
on January 3 and January 12:

These values are compatible with the recent onset of an increasing trend
of the flux at optical wavelengths. We will continue monitoring the source
in the following nights. Multi-wavelength follow-up is encouraged.

ATEL #11197,"
XMM-Newton discovered a bright X-ray transient during a slew made on 05.01.2018
(#ATel11182). The transient is positionally consistent within the uncertainty
with the known X-ray source XMMSL2 J053629.4-675940. Taking into account
the positional uncertainty of the catalogued source RA=05:36:30.35, Dec=-67:59:35.9
(with an error of ~2 arcsec), #ATel11185 reported the observed OGLE counterpart.
In the following table the results of an extensive archival search of possible
counterparts are presented. They are based on three all-sky surveys (2MASS,
WISE, GAIA), Hubble Guide Star Catalog and two Magellanic Clouds surveys
(MCPS and SAGE(Meixner et al. 2006)), resulting of a SED between ~ 0.37
and 22.2µm. The search was done within the error circle of the XMMSL2
J053629.4-675940 position. The distance (in degrees) of the encountered
object from the search center is reported in the fourth column of the table

Notably the I band magnitude and V-I color reported by the Magellanic
Cloud Photometric Survey (MCPS) are consistent within the errorbars with
the OGLE values in #ATel11185. According to the LMC Extinction Retrieval
Service (Zaritsky et al. 2004; http://djuma.as.arizona.edu/~dennis/lmcext.html),
the weighted mean of the Av values derived in a 5 arcminutes radius for
cool, hot and all stars is 0.5+/-0.2 mags. Based on these the following
colors are calculated (V-R)0=0.7+/-0.6; (V-I)0=2.9+/-0.3; (V-J)0=4.4+/-0.4;
(V-H)0=4.9+/-0.4; (V-Ks)0=5.2+/-0.5. According to the results of Ducati
et al. 2001, these colors are not consistent with any main sequence star
(too red), but are in a broad agreement with the expected colors for a
M spectral type giant or supergiant. This is also consistent with the shape
of the SED in the Spitzer and WISE passbands. Such a conclusion is contradicting
the reported relatively large proper motion of the object. A chance superposition
of two objects on the sky, one of them nearby with a large proper motion
is a possible explanation. Further observations and analysis of this potentially
interesting object are strongly encouraged.

is outside of the field of view. Neither ROSAT source is consistent with
the updated MAXI error regions. 

We therefore conclude that MAXI J1630-276 has likely turned off. Based
on the low background level, and non-detection of any sources, we place
a 90% confidence upper limit on the brightness of MAXI J1630-276 of ~10<sup>-2</sup>
XRT count/s, assuming the spectral parameters given in ATEL #11173, this
equates to a flux of 8 x 10<sup>-13</sup> erg/s/cm<sup>2</sup> (0.5 - 10
keV). We note that this level is not consistent (~2 orders of magnitude
lower) than the expected flux as extrapolated from the MAXI measured decay
rate between 2017 December 6 and 2017 December 24 (ATEL #11173). This suggests
that the source may have turned off rapidly, for example as a result of
the propeller effect.

The Asiago Transient Classification Program (Tomasella et al. 2014, AN,
335, 841) reports the spectroscopic classification of  
ASAS-SN18ao (aka AT2018gm, Atel #11178) discovered during the ongoing All
Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014). 

The observations were performed with the Asiago 1.82 m Copernico Telescope
equipped with AFOSC (range 340-820 nm; resolution 1.4 nm). 

Survey Name   | IAI Name      | Discovery date (UT)  | Discovery mag

|2018–01-16 23:18:00  |   Ia   | 0.058     | (1)  | 

(1) According to the classification reported in Atel #11180, the best match
of ASAS-SN18ao is with Type Ia SNe around maximum light. Assuming a redshift
of 0.058, derived from SNID and GELATO spectral fitting and in agreement
with the photoZ (0.063) of the host galaxy from SDSS14, an expansion velocity
of about 10900 km/s is derived from the Si II 635.5 nm absorption.

We report a bright X-ray transient in the LMC from an XMM-Newton slew made
on 
5th January 2018. The source, XMMSL2 J053629.4-675940, had a soft X-ray
(0.2-2 keV) count rate 
in the EPIC-pn detector, medium filter of 1.82+/-0.56 c/s, equivalent to
a flux Fx=2.3+/-0.7E-12 ergs/s/cm2 for a nominal spectrum of a power-law
of slope 2 absorbed by a column NH=3E20 cm^-2. 

The slew position is RA: 05h36m29.4s, DEC: -67d59m40s with a 1-sigma error
circle of 8 arcseconds, lying at 7 arcseconds from the XMM-Newton serendipitous
catalogue source, 3XMM J053630.3-675935, which with a flux Fx~1.1E-14 ergs/s/cm2
(2012-03-24), is a factor ~200 fainter than the slew measurement. The source
was not detected in the ROSAT all-sky-survey (upper limit Fx<1.3E-13 ergs/s/cm2).

Assuming that 3XMM J053630.3-675935 is the counterpart then the best available
position is 

RA: 05h36m30.35s, DEC: -67d59m35.9s  with an error of ~2 arcseconds. 

We encourage follow-up observations to establish the identity of this object.

with a LHIRES spectrograph mounted on a C11 reflector (35micron slit, 2400
lines/mm, R > 11000) with a total exposure time of 1200 sec in the interval
6520-6690A.  At the time, the AAVSO reported V ~ 7.  The spectrum at Halpha
shows a broad, optically thick emission profile with absorption components
at -1540 and -650 km/s (the higher velocity is the broader component).
Some residual emission is also visible beyond -1700 km/s.  The redward
emission wing extends to at least +2500 km/s, S/N is about 100 in the continuum,
the emission being redward extended (skewed) and with peak intensity of
about 10 (emission EW ~ 360 A). The He I 6678A line is not detected.  The
line profile and velocities are typical of the post-maximum stage of expansion,
its brightness suggests this classical nova may also be detected at high
energy, especially with Fermi.  The nova is clearly still in its declining
optically thick stage, the low resolution spectrum from Jan. 14 reported
by Kaufman (AAVSO Alert 609) shows Balmer emission lines of comparable
with to that described here.  Further observations are encouraged.

The FACT collaboration reports an enhanced gamma-ray flux at TeV 
energies from the high-energy peaked BL Lac type object Mrk 421 
(z=0.031). The measurement of last night shows the second highest flux

of the source recorded in six years of monitoring with FACT. 

Since December 2017, Mrk 421 has been showing already some activity at

TeV energies, as reported in the ATels #11077 and #11086 by the FACT 
and HAWC collaborations. 

The source was observed by FACT for a total of 5.5 hours between 1:15 
UTC and 7:05 UTC (MJD 58135). At the beginning of the observation, the

source showed a flux of about 6-7 times that of the Crab Nebula (CU) at

TeV energies, then increasing to more than 9 CU. Over the whole 
observation, the flux was varying between 3 and 10 CU with a decrease 
towards the end of the night and an average flux of roughly 6 CU.

We report on optical and near-IR spectroscopy of QSO TXS0917+624 (radio
and gamma source) which showed a major 2 magnitude flare on 9th of December
2017 
(Spiridonova, Moskvitin and Vlasyuk 2017, ATEL #11048). 

Near-IR spectrum was taken on 2017-12-11 with IRTF telescope in Hawaii,
in Prism and SXD mode. The spectrum is rather featureless and shows marginal
Halpha in emission at z=1.446. 

A low resolution optical spectrum was also taken on 2017-12-19 with Asiago
1.82m Copernico Telescope with AFOSC instrument (range 340-820 nm; resolution
1.4 nm), showed a featureless continuum in rest-frame ultraviolet.  The
new spectrum was compared to the archival SDSS spectrum from 2014-03-06,
which showed broad emission lines of MgII, CIII and CIV. These lines disappeared
in the new spectrum because of a significant increase of synchrotron continuum
most likely connected with jet ejection. 
The behavior of this blazar is consistent with the anti-correlation between
jet continuum and lines EW as shown for 3C345 in Berton et al. 2017, but
in a more extreme fashion. 
The series of intergalactic absorption lines did not change their intensity.

Further spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of this source is strongly
encouraged.

ATEL #11189,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed an intense gamma-ray flare from a source
positionally consistent with the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279, also
known as 3FGL J1256.1-0547 (Acero et al. 2015, ApJS, 218, 23), with radio
coordinates R.A.: 12h56m11.1665s, Dec: -05d47m21.523s (J2000.0; Johnston
et al. 1995, AJ, 110, 880). This blazar has a redshift of z=0.5362 (Marziani
et al. 1996, ApJS, 104, 37). It is one of only seven FSRQs known to be
VHE gamma-ray emitters. 

Preliminary analysis indicates that the source flux has been increasing
in the past few days reaching a high state on January 15 with an average
gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (8.4+/-0.5) x 10^-6 
photons cm^-2 s^-1, a factor of almost 20 greater than the average value
reported in the 3FGL. In particular during 18:00-24:00 UTC the average
flux was (11.6+/-1.5) x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 (statistical uncertainty
only). The corresponding average gamma-ray spectrum had a photon index
(E>100 MeV) of 2.2+/-0.1. 

This flare represents the highest daily gamma-ray flux detected by the
LAT from this blazar since the flare during June 2015 (ATel #7633). This
source is one of the ""LAT Monitored Sources"" and consequently a preliminary
estimation of the daily gamma-ray flux observed by Fermi LAT is publicly
available (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/source/3C_279).

Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring
of this source will continue. In consideration of the ongoing activity
of this source, we encourage multiwavelength 
observations. For this source the Fermi LAT contact people are Greg Madejski
(madejski@slac.stanford.edu) and Masaaki Hayashida (masaaki.hayashida@hepburn.s.chiba-u.ac.jp).

The Fermi LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

ATEL #11190,"		Quasar

Following the increase of gamma-ray activity of the flat spectrum radio
quasar 3C 279 recently observed by Fermi-LAT (ATel #11189), we have activated
follow-up observations with the REM telescope (La Silla, Chile). 

Observations were carried out with REM on 2018 January 17 between 06:32
UT and 06:50 UT, obtaining three 300 s integration images in the optical
g', r', i' bands, and fourteen 15 s integration images in the NIR J, H,
and K bands. 

We obtained for the target the following optical and NIR magnitudes:  

V = 14.39+/-0.05, R = 13.96+/-0.14, I = 13.37+/-0.08  

J = 12.10+/-0.02, H = 11.27+/-0.04, K = 10.27+/-0.04  

The NIR magnitudes were calibrated against the 2MASS catalog; optical calibration
was performed against the APASS catalog. 

According to our photometry, 3C 279 shows a brightening of about 1 mag
in NIR and 0.6-0.8 mag in optical with respect to the mean values observed
by REM during 2005-2012 (see Sandrinelli, et al. 2016, ApJ, 151, 54), in
agreement with the increase of gamma-ray activity observed by Fermi-LAT.

REM will continue to monitor 3C 279 in the following weeks.

As part of an ongoing effort by the ASAS-SN project (Shappee et

to characterize and catalog all bright variable stars, we report the  
discovery of a very bright, long period detached eclipsing binary,  
most likely a system of two massive stars in the LMC. The source  
ASASSN-V J054601.74-665924.2 (position from Gaia, g~13.3)  
was first observed by ASAS-SN on UT 2014-04-29. To date,  
ASASSN-V J054601.74-665924.2 has more than ~1300 V-band data  
points and ~180 g-band data points.

ASAS-SN light curve </a> for ASASSN-V J054601.74-665924.2 clearly 
shows that this is a detached eclipsing binary with a period 
P_ecl=313.4364 days (g-band: red points, V-band: blue points). The ASAS-SN

light curve shows that the V-band and g-band data agree well (g-V ~0),

suggesting that this is an eclipsing binary system composed of two 
massive stars. The eclipses show some asymmetry, with some 
similarity to the long period LMC binary OGLE-LMC-ECL-11893 (Dong et 
al. 2014). When the eclipses are removed from the light curve, we 
find that this source also shows lower-amplitude intrinsic variability

with a period P_intr~15.7 days.

continued support of ASAS-SN. ASAS-SN is funded in part by the Gordon

Since December 2017 the HAWC observatory has observed an increased TeV
gamma-ray emission from Markarian 421. During this period we have observed
a series of flaring episodes, the last one reaching a flux above 1TeV of
(1.2 +/- 0.2) x 10^-10 (~6 equivalent Crab units) between 2018-01-17 06:39
and 09:47 UTC. This is about 10 times the all-time averaged flux measured
by HAWC and the highest one since the beginning of this enhanced period.

This is a follow-up of ATel #11077. Enhanced emission has also been reported
by FACT (ATel #11086 and #11184), and MAXI/GSC (ATel #11186).

HAWC will continue to monitor this source. The next transit will occur
between 6:35 and 12:54 UTC. Follow-up observations are encouraged.

All flux values are obtained from a maximum likelihood fit under the assumption
of a fixed spectral shape with power law index of 2.2 and exponential cut-off
at 5 TeV. The HAWC contact people for this analysis are Jose Andres Garcia-Gonzalez
(IF-UNAM, jagarcia@fisica.unam.mx) and Israel Martinez (UMD, imc@umd.edu).

from the north direction is 0.0 deg counterclockwise. 

We also obtained the source position using 2-4 keV data at 

(R.A., Dec) = (247.860 deg, -27.406 deg) = (16 31 26, -27 24 21) (J2000)

with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short
radii of 0.26 deg and 0.17 deg, respectively. The roll angle of long axis
from the north direction is 11.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an additional
systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius) in both cases.
These error regions are hardly overlapped, but consistent with the previously
reported position (ATel #10984). 

After an unobservable period from November 23 (MJD 58080) to December 6
(MJD 58093) to avoid solar X-rays,  the 2-10 keV count rate obtained with
the image fitting method (Morii et al. 2016, PASJ, 68S, a11) was 0.035(+0.009,
-0.008) counts/s/cm2 
(~16 mCrab) on December 7, and then decreased exponentially with a time
constant of 16.9 +/- 3.3 days. From December 24 (MJD 58111), the source
flux was below the detection limit of GSC. 

A significant spectral change has not been recognized during the outburst.
An averaged GSC spectrum obtained from November 16 to December 24 was described
by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 2.0 +/- 0.3 and a hydrogen
column density nH of (2.8+/-1.5)E22 atoms/cm2 (reduced chi-square: 0.63),
or with an absorbed blackbody with a temperature of kT = 1.5 +/- 0.2 keV
and nH of  < 8.2E21 atoms/cm2 at the 90% confidence level for this nH (reduced
chi-square: 0.76). Note that the total Galactic nH to the direction is
1.5E21 atoms/cm2 (https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Tools/w3nh/w3nh.pl).

The nature of the source is still quite unknown, but a low mass X-ray binary
hosting a neutron-star or  
a black-hole is most likely. 
Swift/XRT followup observations are planned.

Following the discovery (Atel #11158) of the new (fourth) ULX pulsar (in
the peculiar supergiant X-ray binary known as the supernova impostor SN
2010da located in NGC 300, at a distance of 1.86 Mpc) we note that SWIFT/XRT
observed this galaxy again on April 16, 2017, and detected the source still
in a bright X-ray state. The strong modulation of its flux was revealed
with a barycentric period of 30.05+/-0.025 s. Its comparison with the period
measured on December 20, 2016 (Atel #11158) gave the mean spin-up rate
Pdot=(1.47+/-0.01) x 10<sup>-7</sup> s s<sup>-1</sup> which is fastest
ever observed. The corresponding life-time of this pulsar (P/Pdot) is 6.7
years only. 

We applied for new TOO observations of this source with SWIFT/XRT.

ATEL #11175,"
We obtained spectroscopic observations of SN 2018gv with the LRIS spectrograph
on the 10-m Keck I telescope on 2018 Jan 16 UT. The spectrum indicates
that SN 2018gv is a very young, normal Type Ia supernova.  Using SNID (Blondin
& Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), we find a good match to several Type Ia
SNe 10-15 days before maximum brightness.  We note that the small number
of SNe Ia observed at very early phases often results in a bias to later
phases. 

The SN was discovered at 16.5 mag, which assuming a distance modulus of
31.1 mag for the host galaxy NGC 2525 (Tully et al., 2013, AJ, 146, 86T),
corresponds to an absolute magnitude of -14.8 -- or at least 4 mag below
peak brightness.  This further indicates that the SN is particularly young.
If the SN has minimal host reddening, it will peak at V ~ 12 mag. 

We measure an Si II 6355 velocity of -16,800 km/s.  Similarly, we measure
a C II 6580 velocity of -15,300 km/s.  We detect narrow Ca H&K absorption
at the host-galaxy redshift, but do not detect narrow Na D.

Follow-up observations are encouraged. 

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion,
ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-18xx transient names as our primary
nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients),
and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as
ASASSN-18xx (AT 2018xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin
of the transient. 

We thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their continued support

ATEL #11179,"
Following the discovery of the newly discovered ULX pulsar in NGC 300 
(ATel #11158) we searched the available X-ray data for the evolution of
the spin period of the neutron star and the X-ray luminosity.  
Swift/XRT monitored the system between April and July 2017. The system's
luminosity was found to be approximately constant at  2-4&times;10<SUP>39</SUP>
erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, consistent with those reported for the XMM-Newton observations
(ATel#11158). 

We performed barycentric corrections to the event arrival times and searched
for periodic signals. The signal with the highest significance was found
from the observation performed on April 22, 2017 (obsid: 00049834010) and
we infer a spin period of  26.65&plusmn;0.1 s. 
Considering the initial spin period reported for the system (31.6 s; ATel#11158)
we derive an average spin-up rate -4.6&times;10<SUP>-7</SUP> s over 123
days. 
The analysis of the latest Swift observation (performed on July 12, 2017)
yields a low-significance signal at 24.36 s.  
The long-term spin period evolution is consistent with an exponential decrease,
which implies that P/Pdot is roughly constant as expected during a phase
with steady accretion rate.  
If that trend continued  the current spin period of the system would be
expected around 20 s. 
A new Swift/XRT observation of the system has been approved, that will
help us verify this prediction. 

We note that the spin period detection reported in ATel#11174,  is probably
a multiple of the Swift/XRT frame time in PC mode, and thus an instrumental
feature. 

We thank the Swift team for accepting and scheduling the target of opportunity
observations.

ASASSN-18am/AT2018gk, ASASN-18ao/AT2018gm, and ASASSN-18ap/AT2018gn (ATel

mounted on the F. L. Whipple Observatory 1.5-m telescope. We used SNID
(Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) to aid with the type, phase and
redshift determination. ASASSN-18am has a blue continuum, relatively weak
and broad H-alpha (FWHM ~ 5000 km/s), and strong He II in emission (narrow
and broad features), consistent with a young Type II SN. ASASSN-18ao is
a Type Ia SN around peak with strong host galaxy contamination at z=0.04104
(redshift from host galaxy absorption lines). ASASSN-18ap shows broad H-alpha
and other features characteristic of a Type II SN, also with strong host
galaxy contamination.

Following the report of increased Gamma-Ray activity detected by AGILE
of the high redshift QSO (z=1.037) CTA102 cross identified with the radio
source 4C+11.69 and the Gamma-ray source 2FGLJ2232.4+1143  by Lucarelli
et al.(ATEL #11045). We were already monitoring this  source in the NIR
and found it with an enhanced flux in the J, H and Ks bands. The source
shows an increasing, monotonic trend since MJD 2457997. Furthermore, we
detected a very large NIR flare of this source. On January 5th,2018 MJD(2458123.6551),
we found the source with NIR fluxes corresponding to J = 11.084 +/- 0.03,
H = 10.189 +/- 0.03 and Ks = 9.081 +/- 0.05. While, on MJD 2458100.61 the
fluxes in the NIR bands corresponded to J = 12.370 =/- 0.07, H = 11.463
+/- 0.05 and K = 10.560 +/- 0.07. Hence, the source has increased its flux
by a factor of 4 in the K band in this this rather short lapse. The source
is brightest since the time we started monitoring it on MJD 2454623.9.
Our observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo
Haro Observatory operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics
and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument CANICA a NIR camera.
We encourage further multi wavelength coverage.

(1) The spectrum shows a blue continuum with the Balmer emission lines
at rest wavelength. 

(2) We measure the redshift of the host galaxy from the narrow Halpha emission
(z=0.01668). Even if the spectrum of SN2018bi is noisy (due to bad seeing/sky
condition), a fairly good match is obtained with Type Ia SNe, few days
before maximum light.  
A significant line-of-sight reddening is suggested by the presence of narrow
absorption features that should be attributed to NaI D and also by the
red continuum of the spectrum. The velocity of the ejecta, as measured
from SiII 635.5 nm, is about 9800 km/s. 

(3) The spectrum is characterized by a strong blue continuum. There is
a weak Halpha emission surrounded by broad absorption troughs. The emission
core in Hbeta and Hgamma absorption is only perceptible, while higher Balmer
lines are in pure absorption. 

Classifications were done with GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488,

ATEL #11166,"
We report on the NIR brightening of the low redshift QSO HB89 0109+224
(z=0.261). On November 13th, 2017 MJD(24578070.8843), we found the source
with NIR fluxes J = 12.266+/- 0.05, H = 11.524 +/- 0.05 and Ks = 10.627
+/- 0.06 While, on MJD 2457807 the flux in the H band corresponded to H
= 12.379 +/- 0.05. Hence, the source has increased its flux by a factor
of 2.2 in this lapse. The source is brightest since the time we started
monitoring it (MJD 2455607.62), when the flux in the H band was H = 12.117
+/- 0.04. Our observations are carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the
Guillermo Haro Observatory operated by the National Institute for Astrophysics,
Optics and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with the instrument CANICA a
NIR camera. We encourage further multi wavelength coverage.

We obtained spectra of the transient AT 2017ixr (see <a href=""https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2017ixr"">TNS</a>)
with the SPRAT spectrograph (resolution R ~ 350; <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9147E..8HP"">Piascik
et al. 2014</a>) on the 2-m Liverpool Telescope (LT; <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5489..679S"">Steele
et al. 2004</a>) on 2017 Dec 27.90 and 2018 Jan 12.83 UT. 

The first spectrum (2017 Dec 27) shows narrow H&alpha; emission on a blue
continuum. In the second spectrum (2018 Jan 12) significant evolution is
seen. The H&alpha; emission has strengthened with respect to the continuum,
with H&beta; and H&gamma; now also detected. The spectrum also shows a
number of Fe II lines, including the 42, 48, 49 and 74 multiplets. These
emission lines are narrow, with H&alpha; FWHM < 1,000 km/s. 

We also obtained photometry of AT 2017ixr with the IO:O CCD camera on the
LT and measure it at V = 17.42 +/- 0.01 on 2017 Dec 27.91 and V = 18.65
+/- 0.02 on 2018 Jan 12.84 UT. 

These observations confirm AT 2017ixr is a classical nova eruption in M31
and a member of the Fe II spectroscopic class.

We report optical spectroscopic observations of supernova candidate ASASSN-17rl
/ 2017jea (ATel #11103) done on UT 2017-12-28.47 with DBSP  mounted on
the Hale 5m telescope at Palomar Observatory and on 2018-01-11.92 with
SPRAT mounted on the 2m Liverpool Telescope. The target was discovered
by All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014).
We used SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) to identify the type
and phase of the SN spectra. 

The Halpha emission line from the host galaxy is found at a redshift of
z=0.045. Both of the spectra broadly matches with SNe Ib/c, and the phase
of the later spectrum  (2018-01-12) is found to be near the peak. 

This research uses data obtained through the Telescope Access Program (TAP),
which has been funded by the National Astronomical Observatories of China,
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Special Fund for Astronomy from
the Ministry of Finance. 
Observations obtained with the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory were
obtained as part of an agreement between the National Astronomical Observatories,

instrument on the 2m telescope located at the Haleakala Observatory in
Hawai'i and operated by the Las Cumbres Observatory. Spectral fitting with

The supernova impostor SN 2010da located in NGC 300, later identified as
a likely Supergiant B[e] High-mass X-ray binary (Lau et al. 2016, ApJ,
830, 142 and Villar et al. 2016, ApJ, 830, 11), was observed in outburst
during two long (139 and 82 ks) XMM-Newton observations performed on 2016
December 17 to 20.  
We report the discovery of a strong periodic modulation in the X-ray flux
with a 
pulse period of 31.6 s and a very rapid spin-up, and confirm therefore
that the compact object is a neutron star. The spin period  
is changing from 31.69 s to 31.54 s from the start of the first observation
to the end of the second one (251.3 ks). 
The spin-up during this period is -5.4e-7</SUP>s s<SUP>-1</SUP> 
with additional sinusoidal variations with 6.7e-3 s amplitude and 2.23
d period that we 
associate with the orbital period. 
The spectrum is described by a powerlaw+black body model, leading to a
0.3-10 keV unabsorbed luminosity of 2.9 and 3.1&times;10<SUP>39</SUP>erg
s<SUP>-1</SUP> for the 
first and second observation, respectively. The source is much brighter
than during the outburst of 2010, when the X-ray luminosity was 6&times;10<SUP>38</SUP>erg
s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the SWIFT XRT observation of May 2010 (Immler et al 2010,
Atel#2639) and 2&times;10<SUP>37</SUP>erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the Chandra
observation of September 2010 (Binder et al. 2011, ApJ, 739L, 51).  
We conclude that the source is the fourth case for the new class of ULX
pulsars that already includes M82 X-2, NGC 7793 P13 and NGC 5907 ULX1.

We obtained an optical spectrum (range 375-830 nm) of SN 2018dx(=ASASSN-18aj),
discovered by All Sky Automated Survey for Supernova(ASAS-SN), on UT 11.8
2018 with the 2.16-m telescope (+BFOSC) at Xinglong Station of National
Astronomical Observatories of China (NAOC). The spectrum is consistent
with that of a type Ia supernova a few days before the maximum light. Cross-correlation
with a library of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification""
code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007, Ap.J., 666, 1024) shows that it matches
with SN 2003du at t = -5.0 day from the maximum light. After correcting
for 
a redshift of 0.06(+/-0.005) for its host galaxy SDSS J091612.25+390341.8,
an expansion velocity from 10700 km/s to 13800 km/s can be derived from

We report optical spectroscopic observations of the supernova (SN) 
candidate <a href=""https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2017jmk"">2017jmk</a>

located in the NGC 7541. Two optical spectra were obtained on UT 2018-01-05.1

and UT 2018-01-06.6 with the MDM 2.4m telescope (+ OSMOS; spectral range

398-686 nm) at KPNO and the 2.4m telescope (LJT + YFOSC) located in 
Lijiang, China, respectively.  

The OSMOS spectrum exhibits a broad and weak P-Cygni  H_alpha profile.
The 
estimated H_alpha expansion velocity is ~4700 km/s, which is relatively
low 
for a normal type II SN at a relatively young age (as indicated from the

SN imaging data obtained from the recent, pre-discovery HST observations;
see #Atel 11119).   
The peak of H_alpha is slightly blueshifted (by ~1000 km/s) from the rest
velocity, which is commonly seen in relatively young SNe II. We also identify
host H, N, and S emission 
lines along with narrow Na I D lines at z = 0.0095, which is consistent

with the redshift of the host galaxy NGC 7541 at z = 0.0090 via 
NED. The Na I D lines are partially resolved, and the corresponding D1
and 
D2 lines have equivalent widths of approximately 0.12 nm and 0.10 nm, 
indicative of significant host-galaxy dust extinction. 

We perform multi-band imaging follow-ups from the SAO 1-m Zeiss reflector
with the CCD photometer based on EEV CCD42-40 chip, the 24-in telescope
at Post Observatory as well as Swift UVOT. The Zeiss-100 photometry measurements

The position of SN 2017jmk was serendipitous observed by the Hubble Space

Telescope on multiple occasions during the three months prior to discovery,

as part of program 15145 (PI: Riess). As mentioned in ATel #11119, 
examination of the pre-explosion images reveal no obvious coincident 
progenitor candidate. In light of the reddening and distance to SN 2017jmk,

it may be challenging to obtain good constraints on the pre-explosion 
luminosity of the progenitor.

Alerts team  at magnitude G = 16.48. On GAIA images from 2017-12-20 the
object was fainter than limiting magnitude G = 21.5. So the object became
brighter on more than 5 magnitudes. We detected Gaia18aak (<a href='http://aosimon.org.ua/sites/all/files/gaia18aak-r.png'>Fig.1</a>)
on the images taken on 2018-01-09 (MJD 58127.85). Using the AAVSO catalogue
for photometric calibration we obtained the following magnitudes of the
source (not corrected for the Galactic foreground extinction): V = 17.10
&plusmn; 0.07, R = 17.23 &plusmn; 0.09, I = 17.47 &plusmn; 0.26. On light
curve obtained over 3 hours in R-band we detected variations with the period
of about 0.068<sup>d</sup> and amplitude 0.15<sup>m</sup> (<a href='http://aosimon.org.ua/sites/all/files/gaia2.png'>Fig.2</a>).
Taking into account all these data we can suggest that this object may
be a cataclysmic variable - SU UMa type dwarf nova during superoutburst.
Further observations are encouraged to confirm the object classification
and update the period.

ATEL #11143,"		Transient, Tidal Disruption Event

The optical transient OGLE17jei = SN 2017jei was detected on  
2017-11-15 in a face-on galaxy MRSS 054-118874. OGLE-IV deep stack  
image shows the host galaxy has an extended central feature (bulge  
or/and bar) and the position of the transient coincides with S-E  
part of this structure. It could not be ruled out that the  
transient is associated with the central black hole.  
The OGLE-IV photometry suggests the transient was slowly rising  
from below the detection limit around I=21.5 for the past 60 days  
(latest non-detection on 2017-11-11), about a week ago it suddenly  
increased its rate of brightening reaching a peak at I=17.1 on  
2018-01-06. Spectroscopic observations with the NTT (ePESSTO,  
ATel #11114) were inconclusive suggesting this may be  
a Type IIn SN, TDE or an AGN flare at z=0.058.  

Swift observed OGLE17jei for 1.0ks on 2018-01-07. Swift/XRT  
detected no X-ray source at the position of the transient with  
an upper limit of 0.005 +/-0.002 cts/s. Assuming power law  
emission with the photon index of 2 and HI column density of  
4.16x10^20 cm^-2 this translates to the unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV  
flux limit of 2x10^-13 ergs/cm^2/s. 

An ultraviolet source is detected at the position of the transient  
with the following UVOT magnitudes (Vega system):  

Band   Mag.  Err. 
UVW2  16.78  0.06 
UVM2  16.55  0.09 
UVW1  16.49  0.07 
U   16.52  0.07 
B   17.57  0.09 
V   17.39  0.14 

We also use the UVOT images to measure the position of OGLE17jei:  
03:14:11.94 -71:12:25.5 +/-0.1"" J2000 which is 1.1"" from the  
reported position of the host galaxy. Taking into account the  
Galactic reddening of E(B-V)=0.033 (Schlafly et al. 2011 ApJ,  
737, 103) the ultraviolet magnitudes correspond to the color  
temperature of about 14000 K, consistent with OGLE17jei  
being a peculiar Type IIn supernova.

with a broadband luminance filter (400-700 nm) located at the Embry Riddle
Aeronautical University, Florida. The derived magnitudes were calibrated
with the standard stars in the field of this nova. The total exposure time
for each reported magnitude varied between  5 minutes to 1 hour.

ATEL #11146,"
We report new spectroscopic classifications by OzDES of supernovae discovered
by the Dark Energy Survey (ATEL #4668). The spectra (370-885nm) were obtained
with the AAOmega Spectrograph (Saunders et al. 2004, SPIE, 5492, 389) and
the 2dF fibre positioner at the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). Object
classification was performed using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666,
1024), superfit (Howell and Wang, 2002, BAAS, 34, 1256) and DASH (https://github.com/daniel-muthukrishna/DASH),

ATEL #11149,"
The tenth consecutive annual eruption of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a
was discovered on New Year's Eve 2017 (ATel #11116). A sub-set of the follow-up
observations have subsequently been reported in ATels #11117, #11118, #11121,
#11124, #11125, #11126, #11130, #11133, #11134, and #11144. Comprehensive
multi-wavelength studies of previous eruptions have been published in Darnley

observations during the 'final decline' phase (t>8 days; see <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...833..149D"">Darnley
et al. 2016</a>) of the 2017 eruption. Each of the four reported observations
consists of 3&times;450s exposures taken in dark conditions at airmass
&le;1.16 with median seeing of 1''. 

Date (UT)              Photometry 
2018 Jan 09.823&plusmn;0.008  u'=21.69&plusmn;0.05

The optical light curve evolution of the 2017 eruption has, to date, followed
the light curve templates derived from the 2013, 2014, and 2015 eruptions
(<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...833..149D"">Darnley et

2017 Dec 31.3&plusmn;0.1 UT. As such, these observations were taken approximately
9.5 days post-eruption.

We report optical spectroscopy of 5 supernova discovered by the Dark Energy
Survey (ATel #4668). The spectra (425-1050) were obtained using the IMACS
on the 6.5m Baade telescope at the Las Campinas Observatory. Object classification
was performed using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) and superfit
(Howell et al, 2005, ApJ, 634, 119), the details of which are reported

We report optical spectroscopy of 2 supernova discovered by the Dark Energy
Survey (ATel #4668). The spectra were obtained using the ESO New Technology
Telescope at La Silla on 2017 Dec 06 and 2017 Dec 08 using EFOSC2. Object
classification was performed using SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666,
1024) and superfit (Howell et al, 2005, ApJ, 634, 119), the details of

ATEL #11141,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed gamma-ray emission from a source positionally
consistent with the radio source PKS 2247-131, with coordinates RA=342.4983854
deg, Dec=-12.8546736 deg (J2000; Beasley et al. 2002, ApJS, 141, 13), and
no measured redshift. This source is not in any published gamma-ray catalog,
but the Fermi-LAT Collaboration already reported gamma-ray flaring activity
from this object in ATels #9285 and #9620. Given the localization errors
of the LAT gamma-ray source, the blazar PKS 2247-131 is the most credible
counterpart. 

The Fermi-LAT significantly detected this object for the first time in
July 2016, and since then the source has shown several periods of increased
activity, as can be seen in the public Fermi-LAT light curves (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/).
The highest flux since the October 2016 outburst was observed on December
11, 2016, with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (4.2+/-0.3)
X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 and a single power-law photon index of 2.29+/-0.07
(statistical uncertainty only). The source has been consistently detected
in the daily LAT data since then, most recently on January 3 with a daily
flux of (2.3+/-0.3) X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 and a single power-law photon
index of 2.1+/-0.1 (statistical uncertainty only). 

Recently, in ATel #11043 and ATel #11127, the AGILE Collaboration announced
the detection of significant gamma-ray emission from AGL J2251-1239, whose
sky position is consistent with the Fermi-LAT source reported here. The
gamma-ray position uncertainties and the estimated flux reported by the
AGILE Collaboration suggest that AGL J2251-1239 is the same object detected
by the LAT, which is associated with PKS 2247-131. 

Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring
of this source will continue. The Fermi-LAT contact person for this source
is S. Buson (sara.buson at gmail.com). 

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

ATEL #11142,"
We report of Swift observations of the Active Galactic Nuclei GAIA 17dev
and GAIA 17dez which were detected by GAIA in an optically 
bright state (A. Delgado et  al. TNS AT report 15273 and 15277, 
respectively). 

Swift observed GAIA 17dev (SDSS J141909.26+060328.4) on 2017 
December 22 and 28 for a total 1111s. Applying the method described 
in Kraft et al. (1991, ApJ 374, 344) we found a 3 sigma upper limit 
in the 0.3-10 keV band with the Swift XRT of 8.7e-3 counts/s  
which is equivalent to an observed flux in the 0.3-10 keV band of  
about 4.5e-16 W m^-2. We did not detect the source in the UVOT and found
the following 3 sigma upper limits (exposure times given in s) in the Vega
system:  V>18.04 mag (63 s), B>19.22 mag (63s), U>18.88 
mag (63s),  W1>19.23 mag (126 s), M2>19.44 mag (178s), W2>19.98 mag 
(256s). The Galactic reddening in the direction of GAIA 17dev is 
E(B-V) =  0.020 (Schafly & Finkbeiner 2011, ApJ 737, 103).  

GAIA 17dez  (3FGL J1159.2-2141) was observed by Swift on 2017  
December 26 for 759s. The source is clearly detectd in the 0.3-10 
keV band at a level of (9.1+4.0-3.7)e-3 counts/s in the Swift XRT 
which is equivalent to an absorbed flux of (4.5+2.0-1.8)e-16  
W m^-2. In the UVOT we found the following magnitudes in the Vega system:
V=17.96+/-0.36 (63s), B=18.12+/-0.15 (63), U=17.87+/-0.17 
(63s), W1=17.53+/-0.13 (125s), M2=17.53+/-0.14 (161s),    
W2=17.73+/-0.11 (251s). These values were not corrected for 
Galactic reddening which in the direction of Gaia 17dev is  
E(B-V) = 0.033 (Schafly & Finkbeiner 2011). 

"
ATEL #11137,"
The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope, has observed enhanced gamma-ray emission from a source
positionally consistent with the Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) TXS
0552+398, also known as B2 0552+39A, with coordinates R.A. = 88.8783567
deg, Decl. = 39.8136569 deg (J2000; Jonhston et al. 1995 AJ, 110, 880),
at redshift of z=2.635 (Wills & Wills 1976 ApJS, 31, 143). This source
is not in any published LAT catalog and was not detected by AGILE or EGRET.

Preliminary analysis indicates that this source went into a high-flux state
on 5 January 2018, with a daily averaged gamma-ray flux (E>100MeV) of (1.3+/-0.2)
X 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 and a single power-law photon index of 1.98+/-0.12
(statistical uncertainty only). 

Because Fermi operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular gamma-ray monitoring
of this source will continue. This source is being added to the ""LAT Monitored
Sources"" and consequently a preliminary estimation of the daily gamma-ray
flux observed by Fermi-LAT will be publicly available (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/).
We encourage further multifrequency observations of this source. The Fermi-LAT
contact person for this source is R. Angioni (angioni at mpifr-bonn.mpg.de).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy
band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international
collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions
across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

We obtained an optical spectrum (range 350-900 nm) of SN 2018K on UT Jan.
7.48 2018 with the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope (LJT+YFOSC) at Lijiang Observatory
of Yunnan Observatories (YNAO). The spectrum is consistent with an SN Ia
at a few days before the maximum light. Cross-correlation with a library
of supernova spectra using the ""Supernova Identification"" code (SNID; Blondin
and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matches with SN 2007F at
t = -8 days from the maximum light. After correcting for a redshift of
0.023 for its host galaxy UGC 01303, an expansion velocity of about 12000
km/s can be derived from the absorption minimum of Si II 635.5 nm. The
spectrum is available on Transient Name Server (TNS, https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018k).

-15.5.<br /> 
(5) Gelato provides a good match with SN 2005la two weeks after maximum.<br
/> 
(6) SNID also finds good matches with SNe Iax (z~0.036). However, at this
redshift the SN would be at -19.0 mag, which is too bright for a SN Iax.
We thus favour the 91T-like classification.<br />

The AGILE Gamma-ray satellite reported a flaring source (AGL J2251-1239)
at  RA=342.83, DEC=-12.66 deg. (J2000) in two recent occasions, ATel #11043
(Dec 8, 2017, Lucarelli et al.) and ATel #11127 (Jan 4, 2018, Piano et
al.). Within the error circle of the Gamma-ray source more than one Blazar
is reported in ATel #11127.  The weather conditions allowed me to observe
only on Jan 6, 2018 one of these potential optical candidates, PKS 2243-123,
with the 30cm telescope of the Foligno Observatory in the V band at airmass
2.1. Due to the already low position of the source in the sky, no other
candidate could be observed. This source is reported in the UCAC4 catalog
at V=16.95, and in the USNO-B1 at B1=16.92, R1=16.77, B2=16.75 R2=15.99,
so it does not seem to be strongly variable. The source is not detected
in my image, with a limiting magnitude V=16.0, so it is unlikely that it
is undergoing a strong optical flare related to the Gamma-ray one.

We report on SALT spectroscopy of transient Gaia18abb/AT2018J, discovered
by Gaia Science Alerts program on 2018-01-02. The transient was detected
in the nucleus of galaxy 2MASX J11005714-2547135. A low resolution (R =
350) SALT/RSS spectra was taken on 2018-01-03, under the SALT Large Programme
on transients (2016-2-LSP-001, PI: Buckley). The spectrum is available
on Transient Name Server (TNS) entry for <a href=https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2018j>2018J</a>.

The spectroscopic classification with SNID code (Blondin & Tonry 2007,
ApJ, 666, 1024) gave an equally poor match to SN type Ia and Ic, probably
due to the presence of host galaxy features, primarily narrow Halpha at
z=0.076. Visual comparison with spectra of supernovae templates suggests
a SN type Ia at about a week past maximum or  SN type Ic few days  before
maximum.

In ATel #11116 we announced the discovery of the predicted 2017 eruption
of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a on 2017-12-31.77 UT. We reported the
follow-up UV detection with Swift/UVOT in ATel #11121. This is the 10th
observed eruption in 10 consecutive years of this unique nova system (cf.
ATels #5607, #6527, #7964, #9848). Comprehensive multi-wavelength studies
of previous eruptions were published by Darnley et al. (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...563L...9D"">2014</a>,
<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...580A..45D"">2015</a>,

Henze et al. (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...563L...8H"">2014</a>,
<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...580A..46H"">2015a</a>,
<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...582L...8H"">2015b</a>,
2018 subm.). For additional optical photometry and spectroscopy of the
ongoing eruption see ATels #11116, #11117, #11118, #11124, #11125, #11126.

Here we report the start of the supersoft X-ray source (SSS) phase of M31N
2008-12a. A faint X-ray counterpart was detected in a 5.2-ks Swift observation
starting on 2018-01-05.48 UT. We measured the preliminary XRT count rate
to be (3.1&plusmn;1.0) &times; 10<SUP>-3</SUP> ct/s (corrected for vignetting,
dead time and PSF). No X-ray source was detected in the preceding 1.2-ks
Swift observation on 2018-01-04.48 UT with an 3&sigma; upper limit of 6.0
&times; 10<SUP>-3</SUP> ct/s. 

If we assume an eruption date of 2017-12-31.77 UT (MJD 58118.77), identical
to the discovery date (ATel #11116), then the SSS counterpart appeared
around day 4.7 after eruption. This preliminary estimate is somewhat earlier
than the 5.9&plusmn;0.5 days measured in 2014 (ATel #6558, Henze et al.
<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...580A..46H"">2015</a>),
the 5.7&plusmn;0.5 days seen in 2015 (ATel #7984, Darnley & Henze et al.
<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...833..149D"">2016</a>),
and the 5.8 days observed for the peculiar 2016 eruption (ATel #9872).
This might suggest an earlier eruption date, which we are currently working
on constraining more accurately. 

In addition, the nova is still detected as an UV source but its magnitude
has declined significantly to uvw2 = 19.3&plusmn;0.1 mag (cf. ATel #11121).
Our preliminary magnitudes use the UVOT photometric system (Poole et al.
<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.383..627P"">2008</a>, Breeveld
et al. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AIPC.1358..373B"">2011</a>)
and have not been corrected for extinction. 

We wish to thank the Swift Team for the rapid scheduling of the observations,
in particular B. Cenko, the duty scientists, and the science planners.

We confirm the optical transient ASAS-SN 17pf as a nova in the Large Magellanic
Cloud, based on recent spectroscopy. This nova is located at RA = 5:30:16.77,
Dec = -73:16:11.3 (J2000). Its ASAS-SN light curve shows a multi-peaked
structure; the initial, brightest peak reached V~11.8 mag on 2017 Dec 7
and a recent re-brightening more than 3 weeks after the initial peak reached
V~12.8 mag. We have obtained several spectra, the most recent using the
Magellan Telescope and the MAGE spectrograph on 2017 Dec 30. The spectrum
shows Balmer emission lines with a complex line structure and a systemic
velocity of about 250 km/s, consistent with the LMC. These lines have a
FWHM of about 500--650 km/s and wings that extend to about 1600 km/s from
rest wavelength. Beyond the Balmer lines, the most prominent emission lines
are those of Fe II and O I, implying that it is an Fe II nova.

ATEL #11131,"
At 05:54:50 UT on 30 Dec 2017, BAT measured a burst in its count rates.

Because Swift was slewing at the time, BAT did not produce a 
corresponding image and trigger on-board.  Subsequent ground analysis 
detected the rate increase and allowed an image reconstruction showing

a strong peak.  The ground-produced location of this source is 
RA,Dec = 104.6378, -3.4917 which is 

RA(J2000) = 6h 58m 33s 

Dec(J2000) = -3d 29' 30"" 

with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including  
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single  
FRED peak with a duration of ~30 seconds.    The peak count rate 
was ~1500 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at the time of the trigger. 

The time-averaged spectrum from T-5.5 to T+17.4 sec is best fit by a simple

power-law model.  The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is

2.26 +- 0.16.  The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.0 +/- 0.6 x 10^-7
erg/cm2. 
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T+0.17 sec in the 15-150 keV band

is 1.2 +- 0.2 ph/cm2/sec.  All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence

level.  

A follow-up observation with Swift/XRT has been scheduled 
to refine the source location, if the source has sufficient 
residual or quiescent flux to be detected at that time. 

Because this source lies on the Galactic plane, and has a 
lightcurve and spectrum consistent with an X-Ray Burst, 
we believe that this is a previously-unknown Galactic 
transient, which we name SWIFT J0658.6-0330 .

stat. c.l.) +/- 0.1 deg (syst.) (R.A., Dec. (J2000): 342.26, -12.74 deg),
compatible with AGL J2251-1239 reported in a flaring state by AGILE on
December 8, 2017 (ATel #11043, F. Lucarelli et al.). 

Integrating from 2018-01-02 08:00 UT to 2018-01-04 08:00 UT, a preliminary
maximum likelihood analysis yields a detection above 5 sigma and a flux
F(E>100 MeV) = (2.8 +/- 0.9) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1. 

The unassociated gamma-ray source 3FGL J2253.1-1237 and the blazars PKS
2247-131, 5BZB J2249-1300, and 5BZQ J2247-1237 are inside the 95% c.l.
AGILE error region, whereas the blazar PKS 2243-123 is within the 99% c.l.

the intermediate redshift quasar CGRaBSJ1006-2159 (z=0.33) and the Gamma-ray
source 3FGLJ1006.7-2159. 
Following the report of the flaring event detected by Fermi LAT (Atel#10952),
We observed the source 
in the NIR, finding that on November 27th, 2017 (MJD 2458084.990012) its
fluxes correspond to J = 15.032 +/- 0.03, H = 14.293 +/- 0.03 and Ks =
12.998 +/- 0.03. The flux in Ks is almost a factor of 2 brighter than the
value reported in the 2MASS catalog. Our observations are carried out with
the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory operated by the National
Institute for Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (Mexico), equipped with
the instrument CANICA a NIR camera. We encourage further multi wavelength
coverage.

ATEL #11123,"
We have continued to monitor the optical transient Gaia17dce which was
detected by Gaia on 2017-11-27 at magnitude G = 16.67. This hostless transient
was already confirmed with our images taken on 2017-12-01 (JD 2458089.21)
with the 2-m RCC telescope at the Terskol Observatory (ATel #11044). The
photometric measurements have shown that Gaia 17dce started to decline
shortly after its discovery. 

</br> 
A forced photometry of this unclassified object (candidate CV?) was performed
from 2017-12-13 to 2017-12-17 with the 2-m telescope at the Terskol Observatory.
The data acquired, especially R-band observations, indicate that Gaia17dce
has faded by more than 4 magnitudes within these four days (<a href='http://aosimon.org.ua/sites/all/files/fig1-gaia17dce.png'>Fig.
1</a>). Using the NOMAD catalog for photometric calibration we measured
the following magnitudes (not corrected for the Galactic foreground extinction):

using R filter. The plot depicts the general decline of the curve with
small brightness variations within 0.2 mag on a time scale of hours. 

</br> 
In addition, our measurements on 2017-12-16 (JD 2458104.18) yielded magnitudes
of V = 21.4 &plusmn; 0.4, B = 20.8 &plusmn; 0.3. It is significant to note
that we did not detect Gaia17dce in CCD images taken on 2017-12-17 through
B, V, R, I filters (limiting mag > 22.0).

observatory</a> ultra-violet/optical telescope (<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005SSRv..120...95R"">UVOT</a>).

Within the framework of a comprehensive monitoring campaign we obtained
the first UVOT data of the 2017 eruption on 2018-01-01.22 UT; only 11 hours
after the discovery on 2017-12-31.77 UT (ATel #11116). The nova was clearly
detected with a uvw2 filter (Vega) magnitude of 17.2&plusmn;0.1 mag (uvw2
central wavelength 193 nm) in a 1-ks observation. 

The magnitude estimate is preliminary, assumes the UVOT photometric system
(<a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.383..627P"">Poole et al.
2008</a>), and has not been corrected for extinction. Nothing is detected
in the corresponding Swift XRT exposure. We will continue to monitor the
UV and X-ray evolution of this exceptional nova. 

We wish to thank the Swift Team for the rapid scheduling of the observations,
in particular B. Cenko, the duty scientists, and the science planners.

ATEL #11119,"
Supernova candidate <a href=""https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2017jmk"">AT
2017jmk</a> in NGC 7541 (z = 0.008969 via NED) was discovered by the POSS
team (R. Gagliano, R. Post, E. Weinberg, J. Newton, T. Puckett) at 18.5
mag on 2017-12-31 01:57:14. We detect AT 2017jmk using HST WFC3 archival
images (HST Proposal 15145, PI: Riess) taken around UT 2017-12-30.5 with
F160W, F350LP and F814W filters. The top-left two panels of this <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/mtm5bmpb5pgft9y/2017jmk_NGC7541_HST.png?dl=0"">figure</a>
show the HST F160W and F350LP images on UT 2017-12-30. The red circle has
a radius of 1"" and is consistent with the position of the transient reported
by the POSS team (RA: 23:14:45.10 Dec: +04:31:51.10). The centroid of AT
2017jmk is at position (551.59, 276.52) on the 2017-12-31 WFC3 F160W image
(idgg9b020_drz.fits). Using Pyraf and WFC3 zero points, we derive preliminary
magnitudes in the ST magnitude system: 

--------------------------------- 
JD           | Filter | ST Mag |              
--------------------------------- 
2458117.99776 | F814W  | 18.5   | 
2458117.98169 | F350LP | 18.4   |    
2458118.05069 | F160W  | 19.1   |     
--------------------------------- 

The field has been repeatedly monitored by WFC3 as part by an ongoing HST
program (Proposal 15145, PI: Riess) with observations in F160W, F350LP,
F555W and F814W filters from 2017-09-21 to 2017-12-30. Older HST archival
images from ACS, WFPC2 and NICMOS also exist for NGC 7541. We show in the
<a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/mtm5bmpb5pgft9y/2017jmk_NGC7541_HST.png?dl=0"">figure</a>
several HST archival images in this field: WFC3 F160W taken on 2017-12-30,
WFC3 F350LP on 2017-12-30, WFC3 F350LP on 2017-12-23, WFC3 F350LP on 2017-12-16,
WFC3 F350LP on 2017-09-21 (HST Proposal 15145, PI: Riess) and ACS F814W
on 2006-08-09 (HST Proposal 10769, PI: Kaaret). There is no obvious source
detected on the HST images taken on 2017-12-23 and before, while more careful
analysis can be carried out on these images using the precise (relative)
astrometry derived from the 2017-12-30 HST detections. These HST data can
potentially provide excellent near-explosion and pre-explosion constraints
on the probable supernova AT 2017jmk and its progenitor.  

Applying a distance module of 32.9 derived using SN Ia 1998dh exploded
in NGC 7541 (Jha et al. 2007) and A_V = 0.2 (via NED), the absolute magnitude
AT 2017jmk at discovery was at about -14.6 mag  (apparent magnitude 18.5
mag), suggesting that it is possibly young. Follow-up observations are
strongly encouraged.

spectrum of this eruption at Dec 31.88 UT.  

This spectrum shows clear detection of H&alpha;, H&beta;, H&gamma;, and
H&delta; emission lines on top of the detected continuum. The spectrum
is similar to the early time spectra obtained after the 2015 (Darnley et
at. <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...833..149D"">2016</a>)
and 2016 eruptions (Henze et al. submitted). This spectrum confirms that
this transient event is the 2017 eruption of M31N 2008-12a.  

Follow-up observations at all wavelengths are strongly encouraged.
